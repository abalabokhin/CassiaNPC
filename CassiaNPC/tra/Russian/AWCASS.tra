@1   = ~Well met stranger. I am Cassia, priestess and cleric of the Church of Helm. How might this servant of the Vigilant One be of aid to you?~
@2   = ~You are a servant of Helm? I thought this temple was dedicated to Tempus.~
@3   = ~Greetings Cassia. Might I ask what brings you to Easthaven.~
@4   = ~I'm sorry, but what manner of creature are you?~
@5   = ~You are a Tiefling, aren't you?~
@6   = ~Nothing at the moment. Farewell.~
@7   = ~Indeed it is, and I would advise you give the Foehammer his due respect while in his halls. Nevertheless, this is a holy place of worship and thus it seemed like a better place than any other for a cleric without a hold of their own to seek shelter in this town.~
@8   = ~I see, what brings you to Easthaven?~
@9   = ~Perhaps I shall do just that then. Farewell.~
@10  = ~Yes, I believe that is the term most commonly used. But I'd be grateful if you didn't go around announcing that to the townsfolk. They are wary enough as it is in these times.~
@11  = ~My family's blood bears the mark of a fiend, though I wouldn't be able to tell you where or when it's presence first manifested. Perhaps one of my ancestors made an ill-struck bargain, perhaps they were unwillingly cursed by circumstance, I know not.~
@12  = ~Fascinating. What brings you to Easthaven then, Cassia?~
@13  = ~Excuse me, but I must take my leave.~
@14  = ~Much the same as yourself I imagine. Us Helmites are often sent here to the north as guardians and protectors. It is our duty to remain watchful for the ever encroaching threats of the goblinoid hordes which threaten the Ten Towns and to rise to their defense should the worst come to pass.~
@15  = ~When the Church of Helm heard news of the expedition Hrothgar is putting together, they felt it prudent to send some of their own as aid.~
@16  = ~I arrived with a few more experienced Watchknights a week ago. Alas, they bade me remain here while they set out to investigate a strange set of tracks which led into the nearby mountains. I pray for their safe return, but my duty to the people of Easthaven remains clear.~
@17  = ~It seems we serve a common cause. Might you be interested in joining my party?~
@18  = ~You think something might have happened to them?~
@19  = ~Hm, good luck with that then. Farewell.~
@20  = ~If something has then their fates are in Helm's hand. Worrying about what if's does no one any good in this instance I'm afraid. But they are far from helpless so I remain anxious for their return.~
@21  = ~You could join up with my party if you wish. I could use your skills as a cleric.~
@22  = ~I see. Farewell.~
@23  = ~Join you? Though I am loathe to admit it, I do grow restless in my vigil here. Watching these fishermen day in day out is not the most riveting pastime.~
@24  = ~Very well. I shall lend my faith and arm to your cause, at least until my fellow Watchknights return. I can promise no more than that I'm afraid.~
@25  = ~Welcome aboard, Cassia. My name is <PLAYER1>, in case you were wondering.~
@26  = ~Perhaps another time then. Right now I have no room for you at my side.~
@27  = ~<PLAYER1> is it? I'll do my best to commit it to memory then. Lead the way.~
@28  = ~May the Great Guard keep you safe, my <LADYLORD>.~
@29  = ~Greetings once again my <LADYLORD>. How can this servant of Helm aid you today?~
@30  = ~I would have you join my party. I find myself in need of a skilled cleric.~
@31  = ~Your companions still have not returned?~
@32  = ~Nothing at the moment, just checking if you are still here.~
@33  = ~No, they have not. But I have my duty as they have theirs.~
@34  = ~Perhaps you would join my party while you wait. Time passes faster among friends and I could use your skills.~
@35  = ~I'm warning you Talassan. You'd do well to curb your destructive impulses while in Easthaven or this servant of the Vigilant One shall do it for you. Now what is it you wanted?~
@36  = ~Ahh, a Helmite. I thought I recognized that smell of pompous self-importance when I arrived.~
@37  = ~Come now, there is no need for such hostilities. I am <PLAYER1>, who might you be?~
@38  = ~And I'm surprised you haven't started frothing at the mouth and torching fishing huts yet. Your patience must be renowned amongst your ilk.~
@39  = ~Fascinating. So what was your name?~
@40  = ~I am Cassia, a cleric of the Church of Helm as I've mentioned. Once my fellow Watchknights return from their scouting mission, we will be joining Hrothgar's expedition across the pass, something I presume you are here to do as well?~ 
@41  = ~As a matter of fact I am. Perhaps we should join forces?~
@42  = ~Watchknights eh? So why did they leave you here all by yourself?~
@43  = ~That's none of your business. Farewell.~
@44  = ~I must have contracted a serious case of frost-fever that I am even considering joining arms with a Talassan. But if your mission apparent is to safeguard Easthaven and by extension the rest of the Ten Towns then I cannot in good conscience object.~
@45  = ~Alright let's go.~
@46  = ~Perhaps later. Farewell.~
@47  = ~I don't see why you would care, but our leader Ser Lordranis, bade me to remain here to safeguard the village while they were away. But the hour of the expeditions departure grows ever closer and I cannot help but worry that something terrible might have befallen them.~
@48  = ~I could use the help of another cleric. And perhaps we'll discover what happened to them while travelling.~
@49  = ~So they abandoned you. How quaint.~
@50  = ~Good luck with that I guess. Farewell.~
@51  = ~Was there anything else you wished to say or are you going to continue gloating?~
@52  = ~Perhaps I could persuade you to join forces with me? There's no telling how long you'll be stuck out here on your own.~
@53  = ~You know what, I think I'll do just that. Farewell.~
@54  = ~Good riddance.~
@55  = ~Oh, it's you again. Did you forget something?~
