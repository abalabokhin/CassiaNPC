@1   = ~The people begin to gather in preparation for our impending departure. And still there is no sign of my fellow knights. I fear we will have to depart without them before long.~
@2   = ~Give it some time. They may yet return.~
@3   = ~Do you think something might have happened to them?~
@4   = ~Maybe they felt the caravan no longer warranted their protection.~
@5   = ~You words are kind but unnecessary. It will not do for me to cling to the wishful hope that they may return.~
@6   = ~I do and it puts me ill at ease. A retinue of Watchknights are not an insurmountable force by any means but still a considerable one.~
@7   = ~I do not believe that. Watchknight Lordranis is a dedicated man of faith and his men would not so readily abandon the cause the Great Guard tasked them with.~
@8   = ~I must now come to terms with the fact that I will likely be the sole member of my retinue joining the caravan. I dearly wish the circumstances were different and that Helm may yet speed their safe return, but the expedition cannot afford further delays at this point.~
@9   = ~You are not alone. Many others are just as ready to lend our aid to the cause.~
@10  = ~A concerning development to be sure but there's nothing we can do about it now.~
@11  = ~It kind of looks like they abandoned you, you know?~
@12  = ~You are right of course, <PLAYER1>. I shouldn't forget that you and many other righteous individuals have pledged themselves to the cause, regardless of the circumstance which may have brought you here.~
@13  = ~I cannot afford to let doubts darken my thoughts at this point. Helm is now counting on me more than ever to do my duty in the other's absence. And I shall do so to the best of my abilities.~
@14  = ~I- suppose it would look like that. I was after all the junior member of the group. Perhaps the others felt I was unprepared for such an dangerous mission and felt it would be best to leave me behind.~
@15  = ~The past week of solitude has certainly been an adjustment for me. Since growing up in Mirabar I have always been surrounded by members of the faith. Now that their absence has had time to sink in, I find myself missing their support, regardless of the circumstances which may have caused it.~
@16  = ~You will manage I am sure. And if your god's support is not enough you have mine as well.~
@17  = ~We all must learn to become self-reliant at some point.~
@18  = ~Mirabar? Is that where you come from?~
@19  = ~And I find myself beginning to miss the blissful silence I was enjoying up until now. Enough dallying about, we have a list to deliver!~
@20  = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>. Your support is most appreciated and I am sure we will work well together in the coming months.~
@21  = ~True enough. Perhaps Watchknight Lordranis felt the same and told me to stay behind for that reason.~
@22  = ~Yes, it is a great mining city of dwarves and humans which stands on the banks of the great River Mirar which flows parallel along the foothills of the Spine of the World into the Sea of Swords.~
@23  = ~The following of Helm in the city isn't particularly widespread, but due to the frequent skirmishes with the orcish hordes in the region many paladins and clerics of Helm have lent their protection to the city.~
@24  = ~But I have wasted enough time. Let us deliver this list with all haste and make our final preparations for the march that lies before us.~
@25  = ~Helm's beard! They are all gone! The mountain has claimed their lives, their supplies, everything!~
@26  = ~This cannot be a coincidence. First a company of knights vanishes in the mountains and now an avalanche just happens to bury an expedition bound for Kuldahar. Something more is going on, I can feel it in my bones.~
@27  = ~Glad to see you're in one piece as well, Cassia.~
@28  = ~Whatever the case may be, that was too close for comfort.~
@29  = ~I don't know. Avalanches happen all the time in the mountains. It could just be bad luck.~
@30  = ~I wish I could say the same for the rest of the caravan. The poor wretched souls that survived the force are likely suffocating beneath the snow by this point.~
@31  = ~If this is bad luck then Beshaba herself must have her fingers in it. Helm preserve us if that is the case.~
@32  = ~We- we should get moving. At the very least we should find somewhere to shelter if we can't make it to Kuldahar. I do not wish to be caught out in the elements when another blizzard hits.~
@33  = ~(Snort) This Arundel certainly has a way of making demands. We arrive at his doorstep, bloodied and frostbitten and he immediately sends us out again into the path of danger, ill-equipped as we are, with little more than pleas and platitudes to accompany us.~
@34  = ~Is this not the task Helm set before you? Why are you dragging your feet?~
@35  = ~The task ahead may carry its risks but whining about it won't make it any easier.~
@36  = ~I agree, but it seems he is giving us little choice in the matter.~
@37  = ~I was tasked with aiding the caravan which is now destroyed, if I need to remind you of that. Who is left to carry out this mission I ask you?~
@38  = ~I am not whining! I am merely trying to be realistic about the situation.~
@39  = ~The druid is expecting things from our group which are far beyond our capabilities. We do not have the manpower or experience to field a proper campaign. We are under equipped, lack any information on what precisely we are dealing with and our enemy has already proven more than ready for us!~
@40  = ~What we should be doing is fortifying the town as best we can until we can send a missive outside the Dale requesting aid. If we are lucky the passes should eventually thaw and then...~
@41  = ~Cassia, listen to me. You need to pull yourself together. Yes things are looking bad now, but it lies in our power to change that.~
@42  = ~Look, I agree that the task at hand can seem monumental but that doesn't mean we can't at least make the attempt.~
@43  = ~...we all end up dead because we were idle and let our opponent pick and choose his battles. Is that what you want?~
@44  = ~How can you be so sure of that? Where is it you draw that kind of confidence from?~
@45  = ~No! Of course not! These people certainly deserve a better fate after all that has befallen them!~
@46  = ~I just feel so powerless. Powerless and afraid that I will be a disappointment to my superiors should I fail in my charge. I know I should be trained to handle situations such as this and yet I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility.~
@47  = ~Don't say that. Take a deep breath and concentrate on the task at hand. Focus on the small things you can change and work from there.~
@48  = ~Does it matter what they think? You are in the here and now. They are not. So pull yourself together and stop worrying about it so much.~
@49  = ~Whatever, I do not have time for this. Fall in line or stay behind, see if I care.~
@50  = ~I... yes, forgive my outburst. I shall try to better control my emotions in the future.~
@51  = ~(Cassia breathes deeply as her gaze drops to the earthen ground and whispers something to herself before looking back up and giving you a curt nod.)~
@52  = ~Just keep calm and focus on the task at hand. I'll try to keep your words in mind.~
@53  = ~And... thank you for being patient with me. I try to keep my emotions under wraps as best I can but I fear the stress of the situation has gotten to me.~
@54  = ~It is understandable I suppose. I too have had a lot of things on my mind since the avalanche.~
@55  = ~Bottling up your emotions isn't exactly healthy you know. Do not be afraid to speak your mind should something trouble you.~
@56  = ~I'm glad I could help. Now if we could move on...~
@57  = ~All the more reason for me not to fall to pieces at the first sign of trouble. It is unfair towards you and everyone else in the group.~
@58  = ~But come now. As I understand it we have a haunted Vale to cleanse and an evil to root out. Perhaps this will prove a welcome distraction for the both of us.~
@59  = ~You are far too kind for your own good you know? When will you have time to vent your troubles if you are stuck listening to me?~
@60  = ~But... I am warmed by your words, <PLAYER1>. Thank you.~
@61  = ~Of course. No doubt the threat lurking in this 'Vale' will provide a welcome distraction and allow us the opportunity to do some good.~
@62  = ~Ech, I think I am beginning to reach a newfound disdain for these undead monstrosities. The dead should be the ones watched over by the living and have no business wandering about in this state of false life!~
@63  = ~Does Helm have any specific stance on the undead or is this a personal issue?~
@64  = ~I agree. If the gods are willing we shall purge these rotten cadavers from this Vale for good!~
@65  = ~I don't know, their unique qualities can make for effective guards that never tire nor rest.~
@66  = ~You know you are rather cute when you are worked up like this. Puts some colour in your cheeks.~
@67  = ~In the eyes of the Great Guard, puppeteering the remains of the dead is seen as an abhorrence. Wherever these creatures spring up, we Helmites are encouraged to seek their destruction swiftly and without mercy. It matters little how they came to be, only that they are returned to their final rest.~
@68  = ~I see you know well of what I speak. It is gratifying to hear such stalwart words coming from you.~
@69  = ~They are a disgusting mockery of life is what they are. And given they have only offered token resistance to our intrusion so far, I'd beg to differ on their efficacy as guards.~
@70  = ~(She rolls her eyes at you and her lips twitch as if suppressing a smile.)~
@71  = ~Very funny. I'm surprised you are able to tell, red as I am already.~
@72  = ~To have so many dead reanimated at once in one place... Until now I had assumed that it was merely a side effect of whatever evil is plaguing the dale like Arundel suggested. But now it is clear that this is the work of a servant of Myrkul. I can well imagine the Lord of the Dead would not look kindly upon such a life-filled place as Kuldahar.~
@73  = ~All the more reason for us to redouble our efforts here.~
@74  = ~Do you really think Myrkul has a hand in these disturbances?~
@75  = ~I don't know... this place has ostensibly been here for a very, very long time without causing problems.~
@76  = ~Aye, I am of the same mind. Still we should temper ourselves perhaps a bit, lest we overlook something in our haste.~
@77  = ~No... probably not. But it is difficult for me to say. Myrkul's worshippers tend to be a rather secretive and secluded bunch whose practices I am not overly familiar with.~
@78  = ~That is a fair point. In either case we would do well to remain alert and vigilant as we further our explorations of this place and before long we should start finding the answers to some of our questions.~
@79  = ~Maybe when this is all over I could petition the Church of Helm to sanction a proper sanctification of this Vale. It would certainly be a more permanent solution and put the townspeople of Kuldahar at ease. But I sense that breaking Myrkul's stifling hold on this place might involve a little more than a few dozen vials of holy water.~
@80  = ~We return, and Kuldahar still stands. May the Great Guard be praised for watching over it in our absence.~
@81  = ~Still, pleasant as it is to return to this place of sanctuary there is still much that needs to be done. Supplies need to be restocked and our armor repaired. It will not do for us to be caught unprepared for our next mission, wherever that may lie.~
@82  = ~I'm sure we'll get around to doing those things eventually.~
@83  = ~Sounds like you've made quite the list of chores.~
@84  = ~Don't you ever take the time to rest?~
@85  = ~I hope that will happen sooner rather than later. Helm demands constant vigilance from his followers and it will not do for me to be idle while there is work to be done.~
@86  = ~There was little else for me to think about on our trek back here. Structuring what needs to be done also ensures that nothing is forgotten.~
@87  = ~I will take myself the time when the more pressing matters are squared away. Otherwise I don't think I'd be able to relax anyway.~
@88  = ~But you needn't concern yourself with my wellbeing. These duties bring both a certain familiarity and comfort with them, as much of my practical training as a Cleric involved battlefield logistics and how to properly maintain a field camp during a campaign.~
@89  = ~I had not thought your training was so militant in nature. You sound almost like a cleric of Tempus.~
@90  = ~Interesting, what else did your training involve then?~
@91  = ~That sounds dreadfully boring. Didn't you do anything more exciting?~
@92  = ~It might seem so at first, but the distinctive difference lies in the intent of the lessons. The Tempuran faithful view conflict and battle as a chance to prove their courage in the eyes of their god, whereas for us Helmites conflict is an inevitable consequence of the oath's we take to shield the weak from harm.~
@93  = ~I did undertake extensive martial training, especially in the use and maintenance of heavy plate armor. I still remember the first time they made us novices wear the heavy breastplates during our sparring excercises. Naturally being unaccustomed to the additional strain and weight we quickly exhausted ourselves beneath the burning afternoon sun.~
@94  = ~There was also plenty of religious theory and history concerning Helm and his allies, but also of his foes. We were taught to keep a vigil eye open for the malevolent influences of the likes of Shar or Bane and how to guard ourselves and society at large against them.~
@95  = ~But what I enjoyed the most was the Vigil of Twilight, which was held weekly from dusk until dawn. The High Watcher would gather us novitiates within the great cathedral before the altar upon which he would light a singular candle. He would then ring this old battered bell made out of brass and from that point forward not a soul was to speak. Instead we were to quietly contemplate the will of the Vigilant One as we watched the candle slowly burn down over the course of the night.~
@96  = ~Some of my fellow novices found this to be a tedious ordeal with little purpose. But I greatly enjoyed the meditative peace I felt during that time, even if I did doze off on occasion.~
@97  = ~Thank you for sharing, Cassia. This was most enlightening and I enjoyed learning more about you.~
@98  = ~I must say your training is not at all how I originally pictured it.~
@99  = ~Did you ever consider becoming more focused on your martial skills?~
@100 = ~Was your heritage ever a hindrance in your training?~
@101 = ~Were you ever sent on a military campaign as part of your training.~
@102 = ~Right, next time please warn me before you try and bore me to death with another tale of yours.~
@103 = ~Was there anything else you wished to ask?~
@104 = ~Did your heritage ever have an affect on your training?~
@105 = ~There fortunately weren't any large scale engagements during my training but I did accompany a war party of paladins who were tasked with hunting down pockets of orcs which were preying on merchants and caravans which travelled the roads to and from Mirabar. I was kept away from most of the fighting but it was a... formative experience.~
@106 = ~I only saw their encampment from afar as my brothers and sisters set fire to it. But the stench of blood and ash carried itself far atop the winds. It was grim work that needed to be done in order to ensure the orcs received a strong message not to return to prey on the innocents on the road.~
@107 = ~Not as much as you might think. My adoptive father was a veteran man of the faith as well and commanded some respect among the following in Mirabar. There were some who stared or whispered behind my back of course. But I was fortunate to make a few good friends among my peers who were supportive and kind to me, despite their friend sprouting horns and having a tail which would occasionally get caught in a door.~
@108 = ~I- I think to some of the senior members I was this enigma. A being of fel origins turned to noble purpose by the grace of Helm's tenets. I didn't care much for the false smiles and patronizing behaviour they exhibited towards me as a result from that. But it did mean I was usually safe from any serious mistreatment.~
@109 = ~No I didn't. I know many others who chose to blend both disciplines and have grown into exemplary warriors as well as priests of the faith. But I have always viewed the martial aspect of my training as a necessity, not something that should be explicitly pursued. I know that my decision frustrated one of the Watchknights who had been tasked with overseeing our martial education as he believed I was squandering my skills. But the High Watcher seemed pleased by my decision so I have no particular regrets concerning that matter.~
@110 = ~I'm glad to hear you think so, <PLAYER1>. But come, we have talked long about my past when there is still much to do in the present.~
@111 = ~I can't imagine it was any different from how my peers experienced it. Still, it is but my perspective and I am glad to have been able to share it with you <PLAYER1>.~
@112 = ~You needn't be so rude you know. But I take your meaning and will not waste your time further.~
@113 = ~Here we are then. The best and only tavern in Kuldahar. Not a high bar to pass admittedly but it seems cozy enough.~
@114 = ~Well <PLAYER1>? I believe you promised us free drinks as I recall?~
@115 = ~Of course, just give me a moment to order some.~
@116 = ~Actually, I've changed my mind. This is not a good idea.~
@117 = ~This was a waste of time then. Shall we be off?~
@118 = ~Mhh, much better. I admit, it feels good to be able to sit down and relax for a bit after all that trecking we do up and down the mountainsides.~
@119 = ~It is, isn't it? I don't think I've hiked this much since I came to the North.~
@120 = ~The simple comforts are all the more enjoyable with pleasant company.~
@121 = ~This might be a strange thing to say, but I envy you, <PLAYER1>. You always seem to know what the right thing is to do with any given problem and then you go out and do it. In many ways your example reminds me every day of my own failings and how I must do better.~
@122 = ~I am not the only person setting examples here. I find your dedication to the protection of Kuldahar to be equally inspiring.~
@123 = ~There's no need for that. But I am glad you are trying to better yourself.~
@124 = ~Honestly most of the time I don't know what I'm doing either.~
@125 = ~(Cassia blushes and takes a sip from her Frost Wine.)~
@126 = ~With your company I feel like any less would be doing you a disservice.~
@127 = ~(Chuckles) I don't believe that. Perhaps you aren't always conscious of the fact but you've managed to drag us through more than what others might have managed.~
@128 = ~It's funny you know. When I first joined the company of the Watchknights I thought I was doing all I could to help people. And then you come along and show me that there is so much more that I could be doing.~
@129 = ~It's easier to just help people rather than worrying about the hows and whens.~
@130 = ~I don't really see the big problem. If there is injustice, it must be rectified no matter the cost.~
@131 = ~Sometimes I wish I had that kind of confidence in my own actions. But good intentions alone can lead us astray far too often.~
@132 = ~It is a relief to be able to travel in the company of someone who carries themselves with a similar temperament like myself. It's a weight off my mind knowing I can trust you to do the right thing.~
@133 = ~Indeed. And it's good to know at least someone in this Dale that knows how to keep things professional.~
@134 = ~We work pretty well together, don't we?~
@135 = ~I'm not sure I agree with your assessment, but in the end we do as we must.~
@136 = ~I'm surprised, <PLAYER1>. Usually I find people like you lack the conviction to commit themselves for the greater good. And yet here you are defying all my expectations.~
@137 = ~That's not the only thing I'm pretty good at. I'm a person of many talents after all.~
@138 = ~Hey, even I can sense that what's going on around here is bad news. If I'm the person that has to play hero, so be it.~
@139 = ~Greater wha-? I don't know what you're on about. I'm just here to plunder the lost treasures of the ages.~
@140 = ~Then I'm looking forward to seeing just what you're capable of.~
@141 = ~The reason of a jester and yet it carries it's own truth. Circumstance they say can make for the unlikeliest of heroes.~
@142 = ~See, now that's the attitude I was expecting. But who's to say that opulence could not be accompanied with a good deed?~
@143 = ~Sometimes you're a right bastard, you know that <PLAYER1>? But you're principled. Disciplined. And despite my misgivings about your attitude at times I can't help but respect your results. In some ways I feel we've made better progress under your command than what we might have accomplished with a more soft-hearted leader.~
@144 = ~Desperate times call for desperate measures. Our pragmatism will be tested in the days to come.~
@145 = ~Your observations are appreciated. It is good to see that you have an eye for what is truly important.~
@146 = ~So long as you continue to pull your weight things will be just fine.~
@147 = ~As long as we don't start making compromises for the sake of them I think we'll be fine.~
@148 = ~(Cassia shrugs and takes a sip of her Frost Wine.)~
@149 = ~I'll... try my best.~
@150 = ~I'll admit, sometimes you scare me <PLAYER1>. I keep asking myself if you're really going to see all this through or if you will just cut your losses one morning and run at the first opportunity.~
@151 = ~I've thought about it. But considering what we've encountered so far in the passes, I think I'll take my chances here with you, rather than out there on my own.~
@152 = ~What do you take me for, some sort of coward? I won't leave this stinking Dale until I see the heads roll of the ones that inconvenienced me!~
@153 = ~Yeah, don't get used to it. You might spare yourself the disappointment.~
@154 = ~I know this might not mean much to you, but I am glad you are here with us. Without your skills I don't know how far we might have gotten.~
@155 = ~Hmm, true. I wonder if our enemies know what kind of a mad beast they have unwittingly awoken.~
@156 = ~Don't worry, I won't.~
@157 = ~If I may ask, how are you picturing this will all play out? Once this is over I mean. Will you collect your deserved accolades and head home? Or will you stay and see what adventure the next morning brings?~
@158 = ~Of course I will return home. I miss it dearly in fact.~
@159 = ~Perhaps I will linger a while among the Ten Towns to see if something catches my eye.~
@160 = ~You won't catch me spending a minute longer in this godsforsaken Dale than I must!~
@161 = ~Hmm, that would entirely depend on the intriguing woman whose been travelling with me.~
@162 = ~I don't know. I've not decided yet.~
@163 = ~A toast to home then. And our good health.~
@164 = ~Then I drink to your future adventures. And will pray for your good health.~
@165 = ~Don't worry. I'm sure you'll think of something when the time comes.~
@166 = ~I... you shouldn't pay those kinds of compliments lightly <PLAYER1>. Somebody might start believing them.~
@167 = ~And is that a bad thing?~
@168 = ~Are you feeling alright Cassia? Your cheeks are redder than usual.~
@169 = ~Maybe it's because I'm being serious.~
@170 = ~How can you speak so easily yet sound so sincere at the same time? Perhaps...~
@171 = ~Yes- I mean no of course it isn't! It's just...~
@172 = ~I am perfectly fine. It's just... the wine. Yes the wine has been getting to me.~
@173 = ~(Sigh) I'm sorry <PLAYER1> I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything that's been going on. I just... I just need some time to think about things.~
@174 = ~(Cassia finishes her drink and gets up slowly but not before giving you a regretful smile.)~
@175 = ~Thank you for the company, <PLAYER1>. It was wonderful being able to share a drink with you.~
@176 = ~(Cassia finishes her drink and gets up with a confident smile.)~
@177 = ~Thank you for the company, <PLAYER1>. It was a wonderful diversion from our usual routine.~
@178 = ~(Cassia finishes her drink quickly and gives you a curt nod.)~
@179 = ~Thank you for the drink, <PLAYER1>. Whenever you're ready we can depart.~
@180 = ~Bah, what hope did these faithless fools have? They have forsaken their families and homes to follow the vanity of a mortal man. And then they perished here in the sanctum of their false prophet, perhaps pleading for him to save them when it is the gods they should have turned to.~
@181 = ~Maybe, but it is wrong to relish in their deaths regardless.~
@182 = ~The gods are not always as present or gracious as you make them out to be.~
@183 = ~That is a very cruel condemnation Cassia, especially from you.~
@184 = ~Is it? Their folly and wayward behaviour has cost them their lives and has led to the Heartstone Gem falling into far more dangerous hands!~
@185 = ~But what else could they have expected? Mortals by their nature are ever flawed and require the firm hand of the gods to guide them, lest more idiocy of this sort occur!~
@186 = ~The gods may influence our lives but they do not dictate them. In the end we are free to make our own choices.~
@187 = ~I do not believe that. People are far more responsible than you make them out to be.~
@188 = ~The situation seems to be a bit more complex than how you are describing it.~
@189 = ~That is an unfair assessment and you know it. I expected better from you.~
@190 = ~I had you figured for a heartless zealot and it seems I was correct.~
@191 = ~The wrong choices evidently. Who knows what sorts of consequences their actions here may lead to.~
@192 = ~Are they? Can you really make that claim after what you've seen here today?~
@193 = ~It is only that way because you choose to ignore the dead bodies and the empty shrine before you. That is all the proof you should need.~
@194 = ~These fanatics made their bed and I will openly condemn them for their mistakes. If I do not, then who will?~
@195 = ~Leave me, <PLAYER1>. I've no wish to discuss this matter further at the moment. This defeat leaves an ashen taste in my mouth.~
@196 = ~This may be a bad time but I wish to speak with you for a moment, <PLAYER1>. If you would be so kind as to spare a moment.~
@1019 = ~Very well Cassia. What do you need?~
@197 = ~What is it this time, Cassia?~
@198 = ~I don't know, are you done stewing in your own bile?~
@199 = ~No, I don't think I will. Nor will I in the future.~
@200 = ~(She opens her mouth for a moment before closing it and avoiding your gaze, keeping her eyes downcast as if ashamed to meet your eyes.)~
@201 = ~I see. Then allow me to simply keep it short and apologize for the careless words I spoke back at the shrine. Such an attitude was unbecoming of me and neither you, nor anyone else deserved to be subjected to it.~
@202 = ~I wish to apologize for my behaviour back at the shrine. I let my frustrations get the better of me and neither you, nor anyone else deserved to be on the receiving end of my venting.~
@203 = ~It was also not my place to judge the renegade cultists for their actions. They were as much victims of Talona's servants as these villagers are. And if there was indeed any wrongdoing on their part, it would be in the hand of the gods to judge them for it. Not I.~
@204 = ~It sickens me that I let such hubris take ahold of me so easily. What use am I as a servant and watcher of Helm if I cannot even act with the clarity and impartiality that is asked of me. To think I was angry at a bunch of reclusive hermits who were minding their own business and not the depraved servants of Talona that had killed them! I don't even want to know what the High Watcher would say if he could see me now.~
@205 = ~We all make mistakes. There is no need for you to be so hard on yourself.~
@206 = ~At least you are able to admit when you are wrong. Not everyone posesses that kind of introspection.~
@207 = ~I'm not sure but maybe it would help if you loosened up a little. You always seem to be so high strung.~
@208 = ~Yes, he'd probaby be pretty disappointed.~
@209 = ~(She nods glumly and without another word slowly retakes her place in the party, her eyes remaining locked with the floor.)~
@210 = ~But I... that's it? No reprimand? No lecture? You accept my apology just like that?~
@211 = ~Yes, is that so strange to you?~
@212 = ~Well if you want to I could try and improvise something...~
@213 = ~It wasn't that big of a deal Cassia. Get over it.~
@214 = ~Don't patronize me, I am not in the mood for compliments I am undeserving of.~
@215 = ~Sometimes I wonder why you are so hard on yourself, Cassia. And I accept your apology by the way.~
@216 = ~My comment was not intended to offend you. You really need to learn how to relax if something as harmless as that can set you off.~
@217 = ~Fine, be that way. If that's all you have to say for yourself, fall back in line.~
@218 = ~And how precisely would I do that? Wouldn't that sort of behaviour lead to me making more mistakes?~
@219 = ~Maybe, but we wouldn't know until you try, would we?~
@220 = ~I don't think so. I sense you've got a good heart in you, Cassia. You just have to give it space to breathe.~
@221 = ~Well if you're looking for pointers on where to get started I know this lovely place back in Kuldahar...~
@222 = ~Yeah, maybe you're right. Best to stick with what works best for you.~
@223 = ~I guess we wouldn't. Something for me to consider I suppose.~
@224 = ~I don't know, after what's happened so far my instinct is to tighten my grip on my feelings to stop something like this from happening again. But maybe there is some merit to your words and doing so would only make everything worse...~
@225 = ~Well a whole load of good that does me now! I don't suppose you could have brought that up 'before' we began our descent into this place?~
@226 = ~N-no, it's perfectly fine! I am simply more used to being drilled and critiqued at every corner that such simple acceptance does not come easily to me.~
@227 = ~(She sighs faintly but locks eyes with you, giving you a curt nod.)~
@228 = ~Thank you <PLAYER1>. It warms my heart to have such a stalwart and patient companion by my side who is willing to be patient and listen to me.~
@229 = ~Glad to be of service. Now come along, the Heartstone Gem won't find itself.~
@230 = ~Only as a companion? Or maybe something more as well?~
@231 = ~Yeah, yeah. Hugs and kisses all around. Let's get a move on shall we?~
@232 = ~Right you are. Onwards then and may Helm guide our path!~
@233 = ~I- uhm... that is...~
@234 = ~(For a moment it seems as though her skin takes on an even deeper shade of red than usual. Distractedly she looks about the cavern, as if desperate for something to grab her attention, to no avail.)~
@235 = ~...let us just move on for now shall we? The Heartstone Gem must lie deeper within the caverns.~
@236 = ~(In an almost mechanical fashion she retakes her position in the party, but you catch her stealing glances towards you when she thinks you are not looking.)~
@237 = ~A fitting end for this vile servant of Talona. No more shall the dead be twisted to serve the whims of her dark goddess.~
@238 = ~Let us press our advance, <PLAYER1>. We may have broken the vanguard of the dead defending this lair, but there is no telling what yet awaits us further within.~
@239 = ~What could possibly posess a creature to inflict such senseless pain on others for sport?~
@240 = ~Are you feeling alright Cassia?~
@241 = ~Perhaps it served a purpose once.~
@242 = ~Some things are best left unknown.~
@243 = ~Does it matter? It's dead now.~
@244 = ~No. I am furious the likes of which I have never felt before. It is as though behind every door a new horror awaits us.~
@245 = ~Nothing that was done here should ever be justifiable. Purpose or no, practicing torture is still horrifically evil.~
@246 = ~Perhaps you are right. This place and it's atrocities are beginning to take their toll on my mind.~
@247 = ~And how many victims we're claimed before we arrived? How many tortured screams echoed through these halls in the name of his 'art'.~
@248 = ~This place is akin to a rotting ulcer that has infected a wound for far too long. All that there is left is to cut it out and burn it on a pyre.~
@249 = ~Helm be praised that demon is finally dead! Rejoice my comrades, for we have won a glorious victory today and slain a great evil which plagued the north.~
@250 = ~I salute your prowess, <PLAYER1>. It was your cunning strategy which won the day and left the demon's forces dead by our hands.~
@251 = ~I'm just glad we finally managed to get our hands on the damned gem.~
@252 = ~Don't sell yourself short here, Cassia. Your contributions were just as valuable to keeping us alive.~
@253 = ~Tis merely yet another heroic deed to add to my accomplishments. Nothing to make a fuss about.~
@254 = ~Er- yes! Everything went just as I intended it to!~
@255 = ~You know where I come from, it is customary that the victorious hero be rewarded with a kiss from their beloved.~
@256 = ~I'll be sure to defer that compliment to the Great Guard. They were his blessings after all as I am but a vessel of his will. Still it is nice of you to say so.~
@257 = ~And very modest too I see. Why with such a gallant individual such as yourself this fiends death must be merely a footnote in the songs the bards will no doubt sing of you.~
@258 = ~(She laughs and shakes her head, though her moment of repose is cut short as she begins to peer at the Heartstone Gem with a newfound interest.)~
@259 = ~I must say it is smaller than I expected. It is strange to think that such an unseemly gem holds the power that could rival the unsleeping gaze of the Great Guard.~
@260 = ~We should bring it back to Arundel as quickly as possible. We've lost enough time as it is.~
@261 = ~It's a shame we likely won't be able to use it ourselves. I could think of more than a few uses for it.~
@262 = ~Do you think you could try using it?~
@263 = ~You know if that demon had just hidden it somewhere in a pile of treasure we might have missed it.~
@264 = ~Indeed. And I imagine he will be glad to hear people will no longer be getting abducted in the middle of the night.~
@265 = ~Perhaps it is for the best. Such a powerful tool is all to easily misused, even by those with the best intentions.~
@266 = ~No, and I dare not try. Perhaps if something catastrophic were to occur I could petition the Great Guard for aid. But I fear such a course of action would not only be dangerous but also do me irreperable harm, if it doesn't fail outright.~
@267 = ~I do not believe that would have worked. Even from here I can feel the immense power radiating off of the gem, even in its dormant state.~
@268 = ~Still, we are left with the question of what happens next. No doubt we have slain one of the evils that was plaguing Kuldahar. But there are still loose ends aren't there?~
@269 = ~This buildup of troops must have had a purpose beyond guarding this place. Clearly there is something more going on.~
@270 = ~It would certainly seem so, but I'll be damned if I knew what it could be.~
@271 = ~Whatever it is, it could hardly be any more challenging than breaching this place.~
@272 = ~Indeed. Already I can sense Helm urging me to quicken my step. We should return to Kuldahar as soon as possible.~
@273 = ~Whatever it is, this gem should be able to give us the answers we seek. Let us just hope that Arundel will be able to use it like he promised.~
@274 = ~I wouldn't be so sure. What manner of creature would a Demon consider holding a 'vendetta' against? I do not like this one bit, <PLAYER1>.~
@275 = ~(She stops and pauses, catching your gaze with a coy smile playing on her lips.)~
@276 = ~Oh? And does this particular hero already have a certain someone who owes them a kiss?~
@277 = ~Alas, they do. But know that they wish their comrades in arms the same fortune that has visited them.~
@278 = ~That depends. The hero is sure of themselves but whether the beloved obliges has yet to be revealed to them.~
@279 = ~I- er... that is to say they certainly would hope that she- I mean they...~
@280 = ~Oh. Then I wish them all the best for the future.~
@281 = ~(She shakes her head and begins to peer at the Heartstone Gem with a newfound interest.)~
@282 = ~Well if that is the case then perhaps I could fill their role until they've made up their mind?~
@283 = ~(With an almost devilish grace she steps close and gently cups your jaw with a mailed gauntlet. Her eyes hold their gaze with yours as they threaten to draw you in and before you know it she has closed the distance fully as her lips press against yours.)~
@284 = ~(And in a flash the moment is gone as she withdraws from you. Before you can respond she shakes her head with a soft chuckle and begins to peer at the Heartstone Gem with a newfound interest.)~
@285 = ~(Craning her neck back, Cassia stares upwards to the dilapidated spires of the elven stronghold.)~
@286 = ~This must have been an impressive fortress back in it's day. It speaks well of the elven craftsmanship that the structure has endured as well as it has. But I have to wonder if the distinctive shape of the uppermost towers served any function beyond making the construction look like a hand.~
@287 = ~Oh? Is that a professional opinion of yours?~
@288 = ~I think it looks pretty neat.~
@289 = ~We don't have time for sightseeing, Cassia. We need to find Larrel.~
@290 = ~Only a rudimentary one I assure you. If I'd have to evaluate the structures defensibility I'd say that the approach to the main entrance was far too simple. Too few defensive lines and too open. But this may have been different in the past.~
@291 = ~I suppose it serves as a striking silhouette against the skyline. A defiant command or challenge for invaders maybe.~
@292 = ~Or whatever's left of him. I doubt he'll be in much better condition than the rest of the structure.~
@293 = ~Either way this should prove to be a most interesting ascent. There are many records which tell tales of the many ancient elven strongholds which dot the north, dating back to the time when their kind still roamed the land freely. In that time they acted as a line of defense against the evergrowing hordes of orcs and goblins which continue to infest the region to this day.~
@294 = ~I wonder what we will discover during our time here. Perhaps there is something we can learn from these ruins as to what made their defenses against those creatures so effective and allowed them to hold out for so long.~
@295 = ~Hold, <PLAYER1>. Do not let the apparent calm here deceive you. I sense we are being watched by a great many spirits.~
@296 = ~Spirits? I don't see any spirits.~
@297 = ~Dare I ask what they are doing?~
@298 = ~This place is a grave and every level brings a new flavour of dead it seems.~
@299 = ~I wouldn't expect you to. If it were not for the Vigilant One's blessing of sight they would have likely escaped my notice as well.~
@300 = ~I think they are waiting for something... or someone. They are difficult enough to see as it is, even with the aided sight of Helm.~
@301 = ~But these feel different than the reanimated bones and shambling corpses we have fought so far. It almost feels as though these spectres 'should' be alive and yet they are clearly not.~
@302 = ~They cluster along the walls and railings wearing the forms of all ages and sizes, though still distinctly elven. They watch us with faceless stares, their faces devoid of any features replaced by a yawning pit of black.~
@303 = ~What foul magic has taken root in this place? What catastrophe had occurred here that caused so many souls to be reaped from their bodies?~
@304 = ~Perhaps there is something we can do to reverse this. At the very least these souls should not remain shackled here forever.~
@305 = ~Who knows? Whoever cast the spell is likely long dead anyway.~
@306 = ~Does it matter? It has nothing to do with our goal.~
@307 = ~A problem for a different time perhaps. Though it pains me to leave these listless ghosts in such an accursed state we do not have the time to spare for them.~
@308 = ~I wouldn't be so sure. I am no mage by any means but my initial thought would be that this is the site of some depraved necromantic ritual. And those who dedicate themselves to the study of unlife are not know to be particularly quick to die.~
@309 = ~No, no I guess it doesn't matter. It just doesn't feel right to leave these spirits like this. Surely closure must be granted to them eventually.~
@310 = ~Would... would you permit me to take a moment to petition Helm on their behalf? I do not expect a miracle but it may offer these spirits some reassurance that they have not been forgotten.~
@311 = ~Yes, I think that would be appropriate.~
@312 = ~Sure, I guess. What's the worst that could happen?~
@313 = ~May I join you in the ritual?~
@314 = ~No, it's best if we move on as quickly as possible. Your prayer may upset them for all we know.~
@315 = ~You have my permission, Cassia. Though Helm is not of the Seldarine I appreciate the gesture you are attempting on behalf of my kin.~
@316 = ~Don't waste your time. The fate which has befallen my kin lies in the hands of the Seldarine and I do not wish for your God to interfere.~
@317 = ~Very well, perhaps you are right. Still, it hurts knowing there is nothing I can do for their plight.~
@318 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>. It shall only be a moment.~
@319 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>. Your trust shall not be misplaced, I promise.~
@320 = ~I- very well. You know your customs and gods better than I and I shall defer to your wishes in this matter.~
@321 = ~I- yes of course! The prayer I have in mind does not require more than one participant but if your expression of faith is genuine it certainly wouldn't do any harm.~
@322 = ~Uhm... just kneel down right over there. Exactly to the opposite of me. Perfect!~
@323 = ~(Putting away her weapon she kneels down on the cracked stone floor. From her pack she produces both her holy symbol, a plain wax candle and a small phial of holy water.)~
@324 = ~(Carefully she places the items before her, first removing her gauntlets and anointing her hands with the holy water. Then she lights the candle with a snap from her fingers conjuring a spark. Finally she reaches for her holy symbol, grasping it with both her hands as she brings it to rest in her lap.)~
@325 = ~(For a moment she watches the candle burn, her lips moving almost imperceptively in the flickering light as they form soundless words. Then the lids of her eyes begin to close and the words she speaks begin to take manifest sound.)~
@326 = ~Helm, God of Guardians, you whose Eyes are unsleeping. Your faithful servant begs you in this hour to lend your gaze to the cursed elven souls which haunt this long forgotten ruin. Let them feel your presence and know that their suffering has not been forgotten by the gods. Let them know, that their vigil will not last forever and that they too will one day look upon the celestial fields of Arvandor.~
@327 = ~(She opens her eyes but remains seated, listening to her words echo throughout the empty halls of the Severed Hand. After a few moments and seemingly satisfied she snuffs the candle with a pinch of her fingers and returns both it and her holy symbol to her pack before rising to her feet.)~
@328 = ~(While you cannot say whether Helm truly heard your companion's prayer. You certainly feel a touch more watched as you move on, though whether it truly is the attention of a god or simply the dead souls bound to this place you cannot say.)~
@329 = ~By Helm, now that is what I call an inspiring view! It is a shame we so rarely get the oppertunity to appreciate the Dale's natural beauty but these moments more than make up for it.~
@330 = ~I agree it is quite the view. But the vista is not the only marvel before me~
@1020 = ~I'd say some views can become a warm memory not because of what we see, but because with whom we can behold them.~ //credit, Lava del Vortel's line
@331 = ~Now is probably a bad time to mention that I'm afraid of heights, isn't it.~
@332 = ~Whew, all that climbing and fighting has made me rather thirsty. Can I offer you a drink?~
@333 = ~Flatterer. Though you aren't so bad yourself. Ruggedly handsome is what I would call you in fact.~
@334 = ~If you want to I could hold you close. Keep you safe from falling off while we enjoy the view together.~
@335 = ~I'd be more than happy to share a toast with you to commemorate that climb. And perhaps I should reward you with a kiss for being so thoughtful, hmm?~
@336 = ~Still, before we get carried away I would like to discuss 'us'... well is it too early to call it us? You've shown an interest in me during our travels I think... and I must confess to having fallen for your charms, which has left me at a loss on how to proceed.~
@337 = ~I did not venture to the Dale expecting to find someone who would grow so close to my heart. Even now I am unsure whether I can even allow myself to become distracted in such a manner. There is so much at risk and the stakes of our success seem to spiral to greater heights by the day, I just don't know if I can justify putting it all at risk over my own selfish desires.~
@338 = ~That being said, I do confess to holding deeper feelings for you, <PLAYER1>. I have found you to be a pillar of strength and support in our travels throughout the Dale and I have always had a thing for men with integrity. I cannot promise things will end happily. Adventuring is a dangerous business after all and for all I know a stray spell or arrow may claim my life tomorrow. But until that happens, I am willing to see where this relationship might take us.~
@339 = ~As am I. I care about you, Cassia.~
@340 = ~So long as I live I won't let any harm befall you, Cassia. I love you.~
@341 = ~You do know that I only heard half of what you said just now. It is terribly windy up here you know? And there's this beautiful Tiefling that kept distracting me.~
@342 = ~No, I don't feel like I'm ready for something serious like this. I'm sorry Cassia.~
@343 = ~I'm sorry but my heart already belongs to another.~
@344 = ~You must have completely misread my intent. I have no romantic feelings for you.~
@345 = ~Oh... I- I see.~
@346 = ~I'm sorry but this is all terribly embarrassing for me. Please excuse me <PLAYER1>. I wish to be alone for a while.~
@347 = ~Part of me was hoping you would show more reason than I. But the other part of me knows that I must be truly blessed to have met someone as tender as you, <PLAYER1>.~
@348 = ~Gods this is a 'terrible' idea isn't it? I know you mean well <PLAYER1> but please do not needlessly risk your life. The pain of loss goes both ways you know? Now come over here will you...~
@349 = ~You call that distracting? Just wait until she does this.~
@350 = ~(Before you know it, she has wrapped her arms around your waist, pulling you into an intimate embrace as she smiles playfully at you with sparkling eyes. Out of the corner of your eye you notice her tail coiling almost posessively around you, the sensation not unlike a cat brushing up against your leg.)~
@351 = ~(Then with an almost curious hunger she presses her lips against yours, her eyes closing as she savours the closeness the two of you share.)~
@352 = ~(As the moment draws to a close and her lips part from yours, she leans her forehead gently against yours. In this instance you can now feel the uneven roughness of the base of her horn's as they brush against your skin.)~
@353 = ~Now, was there anything else you wanted to talk about? Or shall we simply enjoy the moment up here together?~
@354 = ~Just staying here for a while with you sounds perfect.~
@355 = ~...you know I never realized how rough those horns are.~
@356 = ~As much as I hate to ruin the moment, we can't stand around here idly all day.~
@357 = ~Then that is what we shall do.~
@358 = ~(Her mouth splits into a grin revealing her sharpened canines as she almost provocatively rubs her forehead against yours.)~
@359 = ~You'll get used to them.~
@360 = ~I know. But a few more minutes shouldn't hurt.~
@361 = ~(Carefully the two of you seat yourselves down near the edge of the tower and spend some time taking in the sights and enjoying each other's company.)~
@362 = ~(As you conclude your romantic break, you notice that Cassia now watches you with a newfound tenderness you have not seen her display before.)~
@363 = ~Once long ago we would have stood at the entry to a great dwarven settlement. Now it is reduced to a glorified cavern which has become overgrown with mushrooms and rot.~
@364 = ~This sight depresses me <PLAYER1>. Just think of all the hard work countless masons and craftsdwarves must have once invested in this place. But now it is forever lost, crushed beneath the relentless onslaught of the orcish hordes.~
@365 = ~It is a sad sight I'll admit.~
@366 = ~I honestly didn't expect this place to be so deserted.~
@367 = ~I'm sorry, but are you upset about some ruined stonework?~
@368 = ~Such mindless destruction and for what? Must there always be creatures that are posessed by such an uncontrollable urge to destroy?~
@369 = ~What did you expect? The beasts did not come to this place to conquer. They came to destroy. And once their goal was accomplished they likely scattered back to their holes in the mountains, if infighting over the spoils did not tear them apart.~
@370 = ~It is not just about the stonework but rather what this place represents as a whole. A once prosperous and secure community, now reduced to a shadowy skeleton to be picked dry by carrion feeders. As someone who has dedicated themselves to the safeguarding of the northern towns and communities, few things are as upsetting as witnessing the decayed state this ruin now finds itself in and to think of what it once had been.~
@371 = ~The dwarves could still reclaim it in the future you know. Many great things have been burnt to ash only to be rebuilt.~
@372 = ~Do you worry the same fate might befall Kuldahar?~
@373 = ~It is the way of the world. Old things must crumble to make way for the new.~
@374 = ~Of course, but only if the community of people remains strong and endures. This place was both razed and it's people cut down to the last dwarf. If this site were ever to be reclaimed, it would have to be by fresh hands.~
@375 = ~It crosses my mind more and more frequently as of late. For every step we take towards our goal, the road to it appears to lengthen and time is running out.~
@376 = ~And what has replaced the dwarves which once lived here? Luminous fungus and crazed scavengers who prowl the caverns? No. I cannot accept that should be the way of things. The legacy of this place deserves better.~
@377 = ~Whoever wrote this letter has some nerve, invoking the name of Ilmater in such a blasphemous manner!~
@378 = ~This mockery of the gods shall not stand. We cannot allow this evil to continue to justify it's actions under the guise of this vile masquerade!~
@379 = ~I agree, this cannot go unpunished.~
@380 = ~Perhaps Ilmater 'is' guiding their actions.~
@381 = ~Plenty of gods command and allow bad things to happen all the time. Why would Ilmater be any different?~
@382 = ~If the writer of this letter truly is a servant of the Crying God, then they must be horrifically misguided. I couldn't even begin to fathom what might have caused them to resort to this sort of behaviour.~
@383 = ~Ilmater's dogma prides itself on easing the suffering of other through martyrdom and sacrifice. Nothing of what we have seen here is in the spirit of his teachings.~
@384 = ~False prophets and the self serving will freely claim to serve the will of one god or the other. But in the end their actions are what reveal their duplicitous nature to those of true faith.~
@385 = ~And such falsehoods will not be tolerated in the sight of the Vigilant One. They must be refuted, denounced and expunged before the innocent and unknowing are led astray.~
@386 = ~That is a rather uncompromising attitude.~
@387 = ~People don't need you telling them what is right or wrong.~
@388 = ~If this is so problematic then why has Ilmater not intervened himself?~
@389 = ~Maybe but it is a necessary one. Compromise is most certainly necessary but indulge it too often and you will find your own position and values have been eroded.~
@390 = ~No, but when lies muddy the waters of truth it becomes difficult for an individual to make the informed and correct decisions. Only a society which values it's truth and integrity can hope for long lasting stability. To that end it is imperative that people such us ensure they never have the chance to spread.~
@391 = ~It is not the way of gods to take a direct hand in things. And perhaps he thinks our party can do what needs to be done? I cannot say.~
@392 = ~Tell me, do you have any family <PLAYER1>? It occurs to me that you've never mentioned anything about them.~
@393 = ~I do, and I dearly miss them. Once this is over I would like to visit them.~
@394 = ~I am not on the best terms with my parents. They did not approve of some of my lifes choices.~
@395 = ~That is because I never knew them. I grew up as an orphan with no one to care for me.~
@396 = ~My family is not something I wish to discuss.~
@397 = ~That is a wonderful idea and I would like to accompany you on your visit if you would permit it.~
@398 = ~It's a shame to hear, especially considering the great many things we've accomplished during this journey alone. I hope they reconsider their stance some day, for your sake.~
@399 = ~That's a terrible thing to hear! No child should ever be turned away from a warm hearth and home. Even Helm, who is often viewed as a stoic god, commands us to take pity on the children and to forgive their transgressions.~
@400 = ~Very well. You are certain to have your reasons and I won't pry any further.~
@401 = ~I often think of my own family these days. It feels like it has been ages since I said my goodbyes to them in Mirabar before I set out for the North with the other Watchknights. I like to think they would be proud of me, fighting to protect the people of North and purifying these ancient places in the name of Helm.~
@402 = ~I am sure they are. Would you tell me some more about them?~
@403 = ~It sounds like you're feeling a bit homesick. Would you tell me more of your home?~
@404 = ~Yes and we wont be able to do that standing around. Let's get a move on.~
@405 = ~Y-yes of course. Lead the way.~
@406 = ~Mirabar is truly an inspiring place to be. It is a great example of what different races can build when they come together as one.~
@407 = ~My father, my adoptive father that is, is a ranking cleric within the Church of Helm and was in many ways my role model growing up. He is frequently called to serve Helm's interests and spends much of his time ministering to Mirabar's militia. He is rarely sent on missions away from the city these days, though I think he's glad that is the case as he can spend more time with my mother so that she doesn't feel so alone now that I have left.~
@408 = ~She on the other hand is a seamstress and has run a small sewing business on her own ever since she came to the city with me. The work pays poorly but the mine workers ensure she always has a steady source of customers.~
@409 = ~What about your biological father?~
@410 = ~Whoever my biological father may have been, his absence was not felt. My mother never spoke of him growing up and avoided the question when I asked about it.~
@411 = ~From what little I could piece together she originally came from Luskan, but left shortly after I had been born. She then met my 'new' father in Mirabar when I fell deathly ill at a young age.~
@412 = ~He was the one responsible for nursing me back to health. Though whenever he tells the tale he says that it was the Great Guard's blessing that saved me. It was also part of the reason why he was so resistant to me following in his footsteps initially.~
@413 = ~And what do you think?~
@414 = ~He didn't want you to become a cleric?~
@415 = ~So... after you got better they hooked up just like that?~
@416 = ~I think I would have chosen this path regardless of his intervention, which is the same thing I told him. It is the unwavering stability Helm offers and being able to extend it to others is why I chose to serve.~
@417 = ~Perhaps he feared I only wished to serve out of obligation, in repayment for him saving my life. It took many long nights of arguing and a lot of stubborness on my part to get him to even allow me to speak to the High Watcher about my desire to become trained as a cleric.~
@418 = ~Hah, no it wasn't like that. It wasn't until a few years ago that they officially married and confessed their love openly to one another.~
@419 = ~Before then, while I was still growing up... It was far more like they were good friends. He would regularly show up during the day over lunch to ask how my mother and I were doing. They would talk about the state of things in the city, the latest gossip which one or the other had heard. Never once did one get the impression there was something more going on between the two.~
@420 = ~Maybe they were just good at hiding it.~
@421 = ~I see. So he didn't want you to become a cleric?~
@422 = ~It certainly caught me off guard when they asked me if I would be an honorary bridesmaid on their special day. Though now that I think about it, they might be just as surprised to learn that I happened to find a very special someone during my scant few months of absence.~
@423 = ~Well I would be more than honored to be formally introduced to them. They sound like lovely people.~
@424 = ~I'm not going to be in trouble will I?~
@425 = ~I hope this isn't your way of proposing in a roundabout way.~
@426 = ~I'm sure they would be delighted to meet you. It will certainly make them feel a lot older, seeing their little girl bringing home the thief of her heart.~
@427 = ~Don't worry. I think they'll approve of you. And if not I'll be sure to make a convincing case to them on your behalf.~
@428 = ~(She blushes) Goodness no, I don't think I'd even be ready for such a commitment. It is still much to early for me and I wouldn't want to ruin it by rushing into things.~
@429 = ~But let us leave these thoughts for a different time and venture on. It was, as always, a pleasure to speak to you and hear your thoughts, <PLAYER1>.~
@430 = ~It is good to see that there remains yet one place which has remained free of the hateful evil which has taken root in these mines. These deep gnomes must be crafty individuals indeed to have protected this place for so long.~
@431 = ~It is a travesty what has been done to their people. Their enslavement has been most cruel.~
@432 = ~Alas it hardly matters. It is only a matter of time before this place is discovered.~
@433 = ~Hopefully we will be able to find some rest here. It would be a welcome respite from the rest of this place.~
@434 = ~Not if we put a stop to the villains that did this. And if we continue on the same path which we tread now that will soon become an inevitability.~
@435 = ~I do not think I will be able to rest easily anywhere in this place. How could I when such atrocities are commited up above?~
@436 = ~What shocks me the most is how utilitarian their treatment is. They are not seen as people but as sacks of meat. Their tongues are cut and their eyes gouged out because their masters have no need of them. A mute slave cannot plot behind his masters back, and a blind one cannot spy his moments of weakness.~
@437 = ~May Helm grant me the strength to shatter their chains and to see their tormenters brought before their rightful judgement. Not one of them should escape their reckoning for what has been done in this place.~
@438 = ~They won't, I promise you that.~
@439 = ~These people are twisted but you cannot let it get to you, Cassia.~
@440 = ~Hold on to that fury you feel. It will give you the focus you need.~
@441 = ~I do not usually relish in the anger I am feeling now. But now I eagerly await the vindication I shall experience once we are done with this place.~
@442 = ~May the Great Guard be my witness when I swear that the monsters responsible for these crimes will be brought to justice by my hand!~
@443 = ~And why not? Does the sight of this cruelty not make the blood boil in your veins? Would you not see the evil which has taken here drawn and quartered in punishment for their sins?~
@444 = ~Justice will be done but you must keep a level head if you are to serve it. This hatred does not become you.~
@445 = ~Whatever retrubution you seek to deal must come secondary to caring for the victims of this atrocity. It is they who require your aid, first and foremost.~
@446 = ~If that is what you feel is necessary I will not stop you. Just don't lose your head while you're at it.~
@447 = ~(She clenches her fist tightly but you notice her red eyes soften as she surveys the injured and fearful gnomes which scurry about the town.)~
@448 = ~I have often wondered in my duty if I was perhaps being inconsiderate of the individual. Helm's tenets demand vigilance and obedience to the letter of the law and it is at times all to easy to forget the victims current circumstances in favor of seeing their aggressor punished.~
@449 = ~Do you think I should help them? Take some time during our rest here to tend to their wounded and sick? Would it even make a difference in the grand scheme of things?~
@450 = ~It will matter to them. I am sure they will never forget that sort of kindness.~
@451 = ~Probably not. Better you save your strength for the coming confrontations.~
@452 = ~I believe that is something you will have to decide for yourself, Cassia.~
@453 = ~Very well, <PLAYER1>. It is likely for the best if I reserve myself then. With each foe slain, these gnomes are one step closer to attaining their freedom. That will have to be enough.~
@454 = ~Maybe, but I believe it will ultimately be a wasted effort. Their situation should improve on it's own once we have slain their tormentors.~
@455 = ~Ugh, overcoming this fortification was an important victory but a most painful one. My armor is in dire need of repairs after the punishment it withstood from those arrows.~
@456 = ~Can we take a moment to cool down in here before we continue? I thought we might talk a bit during our reprieve from the heat <PLAYER1>.~
@457 = ~Some rest should be in order. But we should first tend to our wounds before they become infected.~
@458 = ~Hmm, now that you mention it I think my own equipment could use some patching up.~
@459 = ~We've not the time to linger here. Our enemies might send a patrol at any moment to come looking for us.~
@460 = ~In a moment. I think I have dented piece of plate digging itself into one of my ribs.~
@461 = ~Good thing we are near a forge. There have to be some things lying around here we can use as spare materials.~
@462 = ~(As you make yourselves comfortable on one of the beds, Cassia sits herself down beside you, removing her gauntlets before she begins to fumble for the buckles which secure her breastplate. She pauses and glances at you briefly.)~
@463 = ~You don't mind if I remove my armor do you? It should be safe enough for the moment and it would help speed my repairs but if it makes you uncomfortable...~
@464 = ~Actually that's a splendid idea. I'm sweating like a pig myself.~
@465 = ~Go ahead. I'll keep mine on I think but I won't stop you.~
@466 = ~No, I don't think this is a good idea. We need to keep moving while we still can.~
@467 = ~Aye, right you are <PLAYER1>. Let me finish patching up my armor quickly and then we can be underway.~
@468 = ~(Cassia slides out of her armor and gambeson, turning around to face you as she places the breastplate on her lap. As she is inspecting the puncturing damage her armor sustained you realize that her white, worn undershirt is completely drenched with sweat and leaves very little to your imagination.)~
@469 = ~Uhm, Cassia your shirt...~
@470 = ~You know you're quite the looker under all that armor.~
@471 = ~(Politely cough and look away.)~
@472 = ~What? Oh dear! Let me just...~
@473 = ~(She quickly reaches into her pack and pulls out a dry shirt. Turning her back to you she changes out of the soaked undershirt and replaces it with the dry one before turning back to you)~
@474 = ~There, much better. When I first set out for the Ten Towns I packed clothes to prepare for the tundra, not to enter a smelter!~
@475 = ~It is kind of strange seeing you out of all that armor. You always wear it like a second skin.~
@476 = ~You've got nothing to be ashamed of. In fact I could get used to those kinds of slip ups!~
@477 = ~Ugh, from the smell that was also when you last bathed!~
@478 = ~We Helmites might like our suits of plate. But getting used to sleeping in armor is a safety precaution for the road rather than a personal choice, I assure you.~
@479 = ~(Cassia's cheeks blush an even deeper red than usual.)~
@480 = ~Hah! As if you're any better. Unfortunately circumstance leaves us with only the snow of the glacier to wash our faces in, rather than scented baths.~
@481 = ~So how have you been holding up? It feels like we've been dragged through three different layers of hell ever since we arrived at the gates outside Upper Dorn's deep with each one containing it's own special kind of awfulness.~
@482 = ~It's not been that bad...~
@483 = ~This whole ordeal is exhausting. I wish this were all over soon.~
@484 = ~Every morning I wake up I try to imagine all the creative things I'll do to the master of this place once we catch up with him.~
@485 = ~I was actually more worried about you. Finding out what happened to the other Watchknights couldn't have been easy.~
@486 = ~Seeing all this horrible cruelty on display can be hard. But you help make it bearable.~
@487 = ~You know you needn't hide your feelings from me <PLAYER1>. But perhaps you are simply better at handling the stress than I am.~
@488 = ~Oh yes. There will be a bloody reckoning once we reach them. With each step we take into this lair of madness I can feel Helm's fury burning more and more clearly in my mind.~
@489 = ~(Reaching over she drapes a comforting arm around you and gives you a comforting hug.)~
@1024 = ~Stay strong, <PLAYER1>. We will get through this. I know we will.~
@490 = ~It was a startling revelation I'll admit. How long had they suffered at the hands of the giants? How many were fed to their pets or tortured for sport while we were crawling around the other side of the Dale?~
@491 = ~I have found myself reflecting a lot about the journey that brought us here. It's strange to think back to how different I was at the start of all this in Easthaven. I was just a scared inexperienced cleric that didn't know what to do with herself for lack of guidance. And here I sit now in a place devoid of hope but more sure than ever of what must be done.~
@492 = ~(She glances over at you and noticing the sweat trickling down your brow she quickly produces a washing rag from her pack. Drenching it in warm water from her canteen, she begins to carefully wipe your face clean from the ash and grime which permeates this level of the mines.)~
@493 = ~Thank you, Cassia. Here, have something to drink before you dehydrate yourself.~
@494 = ~You know it will take ten minutes out there before we're covered in soot again right?~
@495 = ~Despite all the terrible things that have happened, I am glad that I was able to meet you and have you by my side.~
@496 = ~(She pauses in her ministrations as she accepts your waterskin, drinking greedily from it as she tilts her head back before handing it back to you with a grateful smile.)~
@497 = ~Then we will simply have to do this again. I will place no conditions on tending to those I care about, my love.~
@498 = ~As am I. It's terrible, you know? I shouldn't be looking for silver linings or trying to rationalize the crimes that were committed here with our meeting. The slaves of this place care not if I tell them what a wonderful and caring person you are to me.~ 
@499 = ~When I first realized I had feelings for you I tried to bury them. Lock them away where they wouldn't interfere with the mission. I was afraid they would somehow compromise myself or my ability to perform my duty to Helm and those that lost their lives on the doomed expedition. But you showed me that I didn't have to hide them at all, that I am able to express myself and be stronger for it.~
@500 = ~(She leans against you with a sigh as her tail coils itself around your waist and along your leg. Outside of her armor she appears almost vulnerable, but despite this she seems fully relaxed by your presence.)~
@501 = ~(Hug her close.)~
@502 = ~(Lean in for a kiss.)~
@503 = ~I wish this moment would last forever.~
@504 = ~As wonderful as it's been we do have to keep moving...~
@505 = ~(Together you listen to the distant bubbling of the magma outside and the steady flow of your breathing. You feel her nuzzle your neck before placing a kiss on your cheek.)~
@506 = ~(Cassia's lips meet yours as she holds you close. You can feel your heartbeats in sync with one another and for a moment all your hardships and pains are forgotten.)~
@1021 = ~Give me a moment to fix up my armor and we can be underway as soon as you are ready, <PLAYER1>.~ 
@1022 = ~As do I. But there is still much to be done. Let me finish fixing up this armor and then I'll come over and take a look at those burns of yours.~
@1023 = ~(She winks at you with a coy smile before refocusing her full attention on repairing her damaged armor. Within the hour you are set and ready to set out again.)~
@507 = ~(Her clenched fist relaxes and for the first time since you have known her, you think you can see tears glistening in her blood red eyes. She looks to you, gives you a nod and hurries over to crouch down by a svirfneblin who is hacking and coughing violently on the ground near one of the run down buildings.)~
@508 = ~The pathway opens. This may well be the final steps we walk together before the final confrontation. Whatever happens beyond this threshold <PLAYER1>, it has been an honor to fight at your side.~
@509 = ~As it has been for me.~
@510 = ~It's quite the climb. Are you sure you are ready?~
@511 = ~Whatever, let's get this over with.~
@512 = ~Then we both know what must be done. What we do here today, we do in the name of the name of the Vigilant One.~
@513 = ~Ready as I will ever be. What we do here today, we do in the name of the name of the Vigilant One.~
@514 = ~Then let us not keep our enemy waiting. What we do here today, we do in the name of the name of the Vigilant One.~
@515 = ~By Helm... what has transpired here? Is this some twisted Illusion the fiend has cast upon us to cloud our senses with twisted memories of the past?~
@516 = ~No, no I can see that this is the reality we find ourselves in. The town must have fallen to the enemy as it was cut off from aid during our absence.~
@517 = ~Where has he gone then? Was he not teleported here with us?~
@518 = ~When I heard him boasting about destroying Easthaven I hoped he was lying. But it seems I was wrong.~
@519 = ~That bastard! Once I get my hands on him I'll make him pay for this!~
@520 = ~It must have been that crystal he was wearing. It seems unlikely he wanted to transport us here as well, considering we had him on his back foot.~
@521 = ~I notice that there is a distinct lack of troops here at the moment. Perhaps we did cause more damage to his forces back in Lower Dorn's Deep than he wanted to admit?~
@522 = ~He may have had the fortune to not emerge in our immediate viscinity but I can sense he is still nearby. Helm's fury now urges me ever onward to see this finished.~
@523 = ~Come, I think I see a stockade to the south. Perhaps there are survivors there who can tell us what happened here.~
@524 = ~You feel it too, do you not? The end is drawing near and soon we shall face our enemy once more.~
@525 = ~Indeed. I am looking forward to seeing this finished.~
@526 = ~We've beaten him before, doing so again should hardly provide a challenge.~
@527 = ~You are tense.~
@528 = ~(She nods and from her body language you can tell that something is bothering her. She shifts from foot to foot, her eyes avoiding yours yet lingering unusually long on the rest of you.)~
@529 = ~I... forgive me but at the precipe of battle I find my thoughts in disarray, not least of all because of you.~
@530 = ~We have fought and bled together throughout our journey through the dale. From the frozen mountain peaks to the fiery pits of this region we have travelled, conquering our foes and slaying evil wherever it opposed us. It has been an adventure that will remain in my memory for a lifetime, and I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@531 = ~And yet on the eve of battle I find my mind is consumed by the fear of what may happen and do not wish to live with the regrets of feelings unexpressed.~
@532 = ~I love you <PLAYER1>, and I worry that mere words do not do my feelings justice. I would ask of you to stay the night with me, that we might take comfort in each other's company while we still can.~
@533 = ~Cassia I... are you sure this is the right time?~
@534 = ~If that is your wish then how could I possibly refuse you...~
@535 = ~I love you too, but I do not feel like we should do this right now.~
@536 = ~Throughout our journey I have doubted and questioned my actions more times than I care to recount. But here and now I can say with certainty that I have never been more sure that this is what I want.~
@537 = ~Then come here and let us partake of each other in full.~
@538 = ~(She halts her approach and takes a few steps back, but then nods with a smile.)~
@539 = ~Very well. Perhaps you are right and this is in fact not the time for such things.~
@540 = ~Lead on then, <PLAYER1>. And may Helm protect us in the coming struggle.~
@541 = ~(She suddenly steps forward and embraces you, silencing you with a heated kiss as one of her hands begin to unfasten the buckle of your belt.)~
@542 = ~Shhh, no more words. For now let us see if we can't get you out of these clothes...~
@543 = ~So, the barbarians are poised to once again stage a campaign against the Ten Towns. Hardly a surprising development given the history of the region but no less troubling. If the clans are truly uniting they could become a force that would overrun the Ten Towns.~
@544 = ~Again? This has happened before?~
@545 = ~If Hjollder believes that we will find a way to stop this conflict and that is what I intend to do.~
@546 = ~Perhaps it is their right then. These are their ancestral lands after all.~
@547 = ~If those savages want a fight I say let them have one.~
@548 = ~Not on this scale. But the barbarians have always held a tense relationship with the people of the Ten Towns. Their grievances are not without merit, mind you, but usually a nonviolent compromise has always been able to be reached.~
@549 = ~True enough. The customs of the Barbarians always struck me as overly superstitious and strange, but I've never known the followers of Tempus to be anything but sincere. If the shaman's vision truly led him to us, then we should do our best to discover what we can do.~
@550 = ~I will not stand by to leave innocent people slaughtered and the very foundations of the Ten Towns razed. Their people have come to call these lands their home as well, whether the tribes like it or not.~
@551 = ~A conflict may ultimately be inevitable but we should at least make the attempt to prevent it before we begin to consign these people to their deaths. They would be the first victims after all.~
@552 = ~If only Lonelywood weren't in such a vulnerable position! Had we the time I would write to the Watchknights in Bryn Shander to lend their aid. A more formidable force standing to protect the town might help calm tempers and make both sides see reason before they come to blows.~
@553 = ~Or it might only antagonize them further. We need to work with the hand we've been dealt.~
@554 = ~Would they even care to involve themselves?~
@555 = ~Too bad, I wouldn't mind a little extra muscle on our side when things turn bloody.~
@556 = ~Aye, true enough. Regretting if's and maybe's has never done anyone any good.~
@557 = ~Certainly! The Church of Helm would never cast aside an earnest plea for protection from the innocent. However as things stand it seems I shall have to fill the role of protector myself in their stead.~
@558 = ~A show of force need not only be for violent ends. It can be both a deterrance and a warning which saves more lives than rushing into battle.~
@559 = ~Let us at the very least try and find the speaker of this Town, before we go rushing off into trouble once more. Anything we could learn about this situation would serve us well.~
@560 = ~Truly this is a place for the dead. Even now I can feel their anger at our intrusion.~
@561 = ~I hate to intrude upon the sanctity of this place. Let us find Hjollder as fast as possible and then leave. We are unwelcome here.~
@562 = ~I agree. I've spent more than my life's share of time crypt delving.~
@563 = ~We will leave once we've concluded our investigation. There must be something here we can use to discredit Wylfdene.~
@564 = ~Not so fast, I want to see what sort of treasures these barbarians have buried among their dead.~
@565 = ~I am glad to hear we are of a mind in this. At least someone around here still acts with honorable intentions.~
@566 = ~If you say so. Though after having hearing him speak I can firmly state that man has the tongue of a snake.~
@567 = ~You can't be serious! I know we've done our fair share of despoiling over the course of our adventure but these are the treasured belongings of the honored dead! And who knows what sorts of curses have been laid upon them to prevent their theft? For all you know you'll awaken another Wylfdene!~
@568 = ~I still cannot believe how disingenuous that barbarian king was. Clearly he seeks conflict, reason be damned! Is that truly who Jerrod was in life? A stubborn, pigheaded oaf that twisted honest intentions and censored dissent?~
@569 = ~Legends rarely reflect the true nature of people.~
@570 = ~Maybe all those years being stuck in a stone did a number on his sanity.~
@571 = ~I'd do the same and more if I was fighting for my people.~
@572 = ~Aye, your words ring true. Let us find Hjollder then before the restless dead claim him as well as us.~
@573 = ~Hah, now there's an idea. Maybe he just got tired of staring at some mold wall in the temple of Easthaven's basement and felt like he needed a little excitement?~
@574 = ~Now go and look what you've done, got me laughing over something entirely inappropriate. Let us find Hjollder before I can embarrass myself further.~
@575 = ~That kind of commitment is either admirable or terrifying depending on who you ask. Let's just find Hjollder before the dead get their hands on him, alright?~
@576 = ~(Shivers) This place has likely not seen the sun's touch since the world was young. It's as though time itself has frozen stiff from the cold.~
@577 = ~Keep your wits about you, <PLAYER1>. I do not like the look of the black ice one bit. If there ever was a place on Faerûn which beckoned insanity into the minds of mortals then it would be here.~
@578 = ~I actually think it's pretty. A place untouched by the outside world in all it's natural beauty.~
@579 = ~You're just being paranoid Cassia. Stop jumping at your own shadow.~
@580 = ~...is it just me or did that glacier just wink at me?~
@581 = ~(Snorts) Don't let yourself be taken in by it's deception. That's how it will get you to lower your guard. Someone has clearly been here before us and somewhat recently as well.~
@582 = ~(She nods slowly, taking deep breaths which turn to vapors as she regards the glacier which closes in around you like spindly fingers.)~
@583 = ~You know you really aren't helping my nerves one bit.~
@584 = ~This seer must have truly hated outside contact for her to come all the way out here. What use is her sight and council if those requiring it perish in their attempts to reach her?~
@585 = ~It is like Hjollder said, only the worthy are deserving of her council.~
@586 = ~Maybe so that people don't bother her with trivial questions?~
@587 = ~Ah, come now. We've faced worse challenges than finding some old crone in an ice cave.~
@588 = ~You aren't getting cold feet are you?~
@589 = ~Or those with a death wish.~
@590 = ~(Sigh) Don't mind me, <PLAYER1>. The cold and darkness of this place puts me ill at ease.~
@591 = ~Let us hope she doesn't consider our request beneath her notice.~
@592 = ~You always find a way to put things into proper perspective, don't you <PLAYER1>?~
@593 = ~(Snickers) You're terrible sometimes, you know that?~
@594 = ~How do you do it? To keep pushing through these hardships as we travel from one depressing corner of the Dale to the next? There is a certain obligation to duty, yes, but it seems a cold comfort by itself.~
@595 = ~I try to keep the innocent people of the Dale in mind. It is for their happiness and safety that I do this.~
@596 = ~If I didn't keep pushing, I'd be the one being pushed. I'm not one to take the easy path.~
@597 = ~We press on because if we don't, nobody else will. The Ten Towns and the Barbarian tribes alike are depending on our success.~
@598 = ~Whatever the nature of the creature that is impersonating Wylfdene it has humiliated and insulted me. I will see it dead for this sleight.~
@599 = ~Sometimes I feel the same, but what choice do we have?~
@600 = ~Yes... that is a good conviction I think. To protect the innocence and community of others so they might live their lives in peace, to know happier times.~
@601 = ~Then you understand what it means to draw strength from stoicism. I can appreciate that.~
@602 = ~True enough. This is bigger than our personal concerns and it lies in our hands to change the fates of those communities. I would do well to remember that.~
@603 = ~Thank you for putting my mind at ease. Let us go then and seek out this 'eyeless' seer, if such an oxymoron would even exist under the gaze of the Vigilant One.~
@604 = ~Sentiments of revenge may blaze hotly but often they burn those that carry them as well. Let us hope then that the Seer holds the weapon we need against the creature Wylfdene.~
@605 = ~I'm sorry, I did not intend for my words to drag you down into the same melancholy I am feeling. Let us simply be about our business and be done with this place.~
@606 = ~So this is the place where the beast has sought refuge throughout all these years. Good. Let us descend into it's lair then and bring an end to it's menace once and for all!~
@607 = ~May the gods guide our blows as we deliver this dragon to it's fitting end.~
@608 = ~Well said! What we do today we do for the safety of all the north!~
@609 = ~Watch that your overconfidence doesn't get you killed, we've still a long fight ahead of us.~
@610 = ~There is no place left to run for it. The dragon will die tonight by my hand!~
@611 = ~It's a shame it has come to this. Dragons are few enough in Faerûn as it is.~
@612 = ~Aye. The beast has gathered it's minions to bar our path, but they shall not avail their mistress. They cannot hope to forestall the retribution we bring!~
@613 = ~Indeed, but victory is now within our sights. So let us go forth and lay low the beast and those creatures that would guard it.~
@614 = ~The monster would have brough ruin and death to all the north in it's madness. I'll not regret it's end.~
@615 = ~In truth, I can scarce believe this is really happening. One moment we were locked in a desperate struggle to avoid a war and now we stand poised to become Dragonslayers.~
@616 = ~(Chuckles) There were so many boastful recruits I trained alongside with who dreamed of this moment. Of how they would rise up and fell a great wyrm beneath their blades. I wonder how many of them would make good on their word if they were in my boots. I'd wager more than a few of them would be second guessing themselves at this point.~
@617 = ~I admit, I am feeling a bit nervous. So many people are now depending on our success.~
@618 = ~You'll have them green with envy once they start hearing the songs they'll sing about us.~
@619 = ~That is why we are here and they are not. They did not have the resolve to get to where we are now.~
@620 = ~People were depending on us before to stop the barbarians from going to war. Slaying a dragon seems almost easier in compare.~
@621 = ~Oh I don't even want to think about what sorts of ludicrous exaggerations they'll weave into the narrative. Let's just make sure this tale ends happily and doesn't turn into a tragedy.~
@622 = ~The gods call us to the place where we might best serve them. And that place for me today is at your side as we confront this monster.~
@623 = ~Lead us forth, <PLAYER1>. This is the hour of our triumph.~
@624 = ~The beast is slain and all the north breathes a sigh of relief. On this day Helm smiles proudly upon us all for ending it's existence and restoring peace to the Ten Towns.~
@625 = ~It sounds like it was taken straight from a fairy tale of old. To descend beneath the frozen ice shelfs to do battle with the soul of an ancient dragon seems almost too strange to be true.~
@626 = ~The battle was hard fought but that's what makes the victory all the sweeter.~
@627 = ~It was a grand tale! The bards will be singing of this for ages!~
@628 = ~Bah, I was hoping it would have amassed a larger hoard to plunder after all those centuries.~
@629 = ~Speaking of victory, I hope we are planning to celebrate it properly? Dragonslaying is thirsty work after all!~
@630 = ~(Embracing you she plants a kiss on your lips, looking up at you with a twinkle in her eyes.)~
@631 = ~And after that we'll still have to make sure you're all in one piece <PLAYER1>, hmm?~
@632 = ~Maybe. At least until another comes along and eclipses our heroics with their own. But the mark we left on history today will endure in the memory of the people.~
@633 = ~And here is something for you to personally remember this moment by.~
@634 = ~(Snickers) Your avarice is truly insatiable at times <PLAYER1>. I'll admit, I was also surprised by it's absence.~
@635 = ~But right now the only treasure I care about is you.~
@636 = ~It is likely that Icasaracht cared for little but her own vengeance in the end. A cautionary tale for us all if we let it consume us as it did her.~
@637 = ~What a mournful sight it is to see this place in ruins. Once it served as an oasis for travelers and adventurers alike within these wastes. And now it has fallen to ruin, overtaken by the desert sands it once kept at bay.~
@638 = ~Without people to shelter this place has lost it's purpose.~
@639 = ~Such is the ebb and flow of civilization. People build great works but they all fall eventually.~
@640 = ~I don't see why you're so upset, it's just some walls and old brickwork.~
@641 = ~Perhaps. But is it not their charge to maintain these places of gathering as well? The decision to abandon this place had to have been made at some point.~
@642 = ~A harsh observation, yet regrettably true at times. Seldom have I ever wished more strongly to prove history wrong.~
@643 = ~There is a history to these walls. They once stood for something. And now it is no more.~
@644 = ~Would that I could undo the years of neglect which have befallen the shrine. But our duty demands we keep moving forward and find the riddling spectre which has beckoned us before we waste away beneath the sun. I wonder if Helm himself remembers this place and how it fell into disrepair?~
@645 = ~Is this to be the fate of all things? To eventually turn to dust and fade from the memory of even the gods?~
@646 = ~Just because something will one day fade does not mean it is inherently without value.~
@647 = ~There are some things which have permanence. The memories and impressions which this place made on it's inhabitants lives on through us.~
@648 = ~Is there any point in thinking about this?~
@649 = ~I don't know.~
@650 = ~Only the value us mortals ascribe to it in the moment. Still, it can be a comforting ideal.~
@651 = ~I like that. Perhaps our being here has reminded Helm of it's existence and of happier times when the faithful gave their prayers here.~
@652 = ~(Smiles) And here I thought you had an answer to everything.~
@653 = ~Whatever force has brought us here, it seems intent on telling us their story. And maybe it hopes we in turn will carry that same story with us to the world beyond these walls so that it no longer languishes forgotten.~
@654 = ~Ah, but I have wasted enough time pontificating. Let us see what the lower crypts have in store for us.~
@655 = ~It must have been a great honor to be chosen to guard this sacred site, High Priest.~
@656 = ~What cause did you have to do that <PLAYER1>? Was it not enough to lie to him that you also felt the need to relieve him of his possessions!~
@657 = ~Have no fear good sir, we shall get to the bottom of this witchcraft, won't we <PLAYER1>?~
@658 = ~The woman in your dreams was a sea spirit, Jhonen. I drove her away; she shouldn't be bothering you anymore.~
@659 = ~The woman in your dreams is a sea spirit, Jhonen. Her kind speak through song, which is why you couldn't understand her.~
@660 = ~I'll see what I can do. If I think of anything, I will return.~
@661 = ~Must we really help enable this drunkard. Surely we have far more pressing matters to attend to.~
@662 = ~Great. I'll be back presently.~
@663 = ~Whoa, whoa. On second thought, I don't think I want to be a part of this. Sorry. Farewell.~
@664 = ~What a pathetic creature. Perhaps we should put it out of it's misery, but I do not feel as though it is worth the effort.~
@665 = ~It feels wrong to simply let this child find his own way after what he experienced. But I can sense that the Great Guard will be watching over him during his travels.~
@666 = ~Farewell, Jermsy.~
@667 = ~No we are not! By Helm what is wrong with you <PLAYER1>!? I won't let you harm this child!~
@668 = ~A rather shortsighted outlook. Perhaps if you helped the community you find yourself a part of, they would be willing to assist you in return.~
@669 = ~While I certainly can't condone the trickery which this halfling involved himself in. But I can't imagine the community will be too upset about it when they hear the truth.~
@670 = ~It is good to see you have taken up the responsibility of tending to the shrine. The townsfolk will need your guidance now more than ever.~
@671 = ~You defend your actions under the guise of duty and yet expect us to forsake ours? If you are truly innocent then stand aside and allow this servant of the Vigilant One to ascertain the truth of your words!~
@672 = ~If you think we would let this come to pass then you are a fool. You and your goddess' destructive plans shall meet their end here today!~
@673 = ~I cannot allow that to happen, Lysan.~
@674 = ~Enough of this, I am leaving. Farewell.~
@675 = ~Your caution will not avail you necromancer! You cannot hope to harm we who are shielded by Helm's even hand!~
@676 = ~That won't help you. I'll still win.~
@677 = ~As will I.~
@678 = ~I have nothing more to say to you.~
@679 = ~Thanks.~
@680 = ~That's a foolish decision. I'll be going for you first.~
@681 = ~Then face me on your own. Or must you hide behind your minions?~
@682 = ~(You notice Cassia's face going pale as she sees the little girl standing before you, her fingers shaking as she clutches her holy symbol.)~
@683 = ~Minions? You mean the snake people?~
@684 = ~What vendetta do you speak of?~
@685 = ~Do you know of the Heartstone Gem?~
@686 = ~I came here to kill your children because they were swiping people from Kuldahar.~
@687 = ~I came here because I know you're the one responsible for everything going on in the pass. The abductions. The strange weather. The undead in the vale. The avalanche. You're behind it all.~
@688 = ~I came here to rip the Heartstone Gem from your cold, dead hands.~
@689 = ~His wounds have been cursed with a strange magic to prevent them from healing. Even the powers of the Great Guard cannot save him now.~
@690 = ~If this is the only way to grant their souls peace, then so be it. But what will happen to you?~
@691 = ~I'm sorry, but does that seem like an appropriate task for an apprentice? I'm beginning to see why he didn't return.~
@692 = ~To witness the power of a god made manifest firsthand... How I wish I could have been there to see it!~
@693 = ~So the undead fell around him just by his presence... how is that possible?~
@694 = ~Let me ask you some other questions.~
@695 = ~I cannot spare any more time for this tale. Farewell.~
@696 = ~May the Great Guard guide you and your people to safety, Gareth. If you head northward following the mountain range you should be able to reach Kuldahar within a few days of travel. There you will find shelter from the icy winds which haunt this dale while you wait for the passes to thaw.~
@697 = ~Fear not Tormite! With the aid of the Vigilant One I shall see this proof aquired so that your soul may rest!~
@698 = ~You don't seriously expect to just be able to walk away from all this? Helm demands that you be brought to trial for the crimes you have committed here!~
@699 = ~No, I *won't* just give it a rest. You'll pay for what you've done.~
@700 = ~How did you wind up here, anyway?~
@701 = ~Your master may have twisted the tenets of the merciful and kindhearted. But even he cannot hope to obfuscate the truth from the piercing gaze of the Vigilant One!~
@702 = ~Your schemes lie in ruin fiend! Now it is time cast you back to the Hells where you belong!~
@703 = ~You disgust me. What do you think she will think once she learns her mother abandoned her!~
@704 = ~Have you no *shame*, woman?! What happened to drive you to such a state?~
@705 = ~Hmmm. If you have a room where we could be alone, then perhaps we can come to an arrangement.~
@706 = ~Your weakness *sickens* me. If you would escape, then you should have the strength to do so. If not, you deserve your fate.~
@707 = ~I must take my leave, Ambere. Farewell.~
@708 = ~The people of the Ten Towns simply wish to avoid unnecessary conflict with your kind. If you escalate there will be innocent blood shed among both peoples, civilized and barbarian alike.~
@709 = ~And what lies did your forked tongue whisper to him I wonder? You are nothing more than a maddened tyrant that would sooner bleed the tribes of the north dry than to acknowledge that your own time has passed.~
@710 = ~(You notice Cassia sneaking glances in your direction when she thinks you aren't looking. The usually stoic cleric has been giving you more of her attention as of late.)~
@711 = ~(Discovered she quickly averts her gaze and does not risk something so foolish again for the next hour.)~
@712 = ~You did remember to pack spare rations like I told you to in case we run out and are unable to forage? Actually nevermind, I'll just lend you some of my own. I'll feel more at ease if I'm keeping track of these things.~
@713 = ~(Cassia takes a moment to readjust the heavy woolen scarf, tugging freeing a lock of her raven black hair which got tangled up in the harness of her armor before tucking it behind her horns.)~
@714 = ~(As though on instinct Cassia has wandered close to your side as she guards your flank with her hawklike gaze.)~
@715 = ~(You suddenly feel her hand brush against yours but she quickly yanks it away as she notices this.)~
@716 = ~(Taking advantage of her close proximity you are able to admire her short yet powerful build. It seems her many years of wearing plate and have left their mark.)~
@717 = ~(Noticing an offending stain on her otherwise polished breastplate she pulls a rag from her pack and tries her best to clean it off before suddenly growing self-conscious as she notices your attention and hurriedly keeps moving.)~
@718 = ~(Smiles) I am glad you've allowed me to travel by your side, <PLAYER1>. There is much good that we can do together.~
@719 = ~Hold still, <PLAYER1> and allow me to tend to your wounds. You'll be of no use to anyone if you bleed out before we make camp.~
@720 = ~Your pack is not too heavy is it? Feel free to give me some of your things if the burden should become too great.~
@721 = ~(She awkwardly clears her throat.) After all it wouldn't do to have you exhaust yourself when there are still battles to be fought.~
@722 = ~(You spot her idly toying with her Holy Symbol which hangs about her neck, occasionally risking cautious glances in your direction.)~
@723 = ~(With a sigh she shakes her head and resumes her place in formation).~
@724 = ~I'm sorry <PLAYER1>, I was just thinking about... nevermind it doesn't really matter what I was thinking about.~
@725 = ~(Suddenly she quickly darts forward and brushes the snow from your shoulders before retreating just as quickly.)~
@726 = ~(Cassia brushes up against you as she straightens out your cloak with a firm tug before retreating with a satisfied nod.)~
@727 = ~There, much better. Wouldn't want it getting caught on anything in the thick of battle after all.~
@728 = ~You look ready to collapse <PLAYER1>. While I admire your drive to keep going it will not do for our enemies to catch you in this state.~
@729 = ~With Helm as my witness, so long as I live I won't allow our foes to overtake you <PLAYER1>.~
@730 = ~(Cassia regards you with a warmly, coy smile playing on her lips. It seems she has made you the center of her attention as of late.)~
@731 = ~(Her eyes shamelessly drink in every nook and cranny of your being as she bites her lip blushing.)~
@732 = ~Forgive me <PLAYER1>, it appears my thoughts have strayed once again.~
@733 = ~(As she walks beside you you can feel her hand snake around your waist protectively, pulling herself closer as she leans against you.)~
@734 = ~(Taking your hand she presses it against her chest above her heart as she giggles.)~
@735 = ~Well, thief of my heart. I trust you are taking good care of that thing of mine which you have stolen?~
@736 = ~My love, how did I never notice just how handsome you are... One of these days I'll have to take the time to admire you in full.~
@737 = ~(Leaning in she briefly nips at your nose before kissing you fully on your lips.)~
@738 = ~(Reaching out she traces her fingers along the contours of your face before letting her hand rest on your chest as she hums contentedly.)~
@739 = ~(Draping her arms around your neck as she brings them to rest on your shoulders as the rest of her body presses against you.)~
@740 = ~Sometimes I feel like the constant battles are weighing me down. But being with you makes all the hardships we face feel worthwhile.~
@741 = ~(Cassia sidles on beside you and leans in to whisper in your ear, her hot breath causing the hair on your neck to stand on end.)~
@742 = ~I'll come find you after I've finished my prayers tonight. I long for a quiet moment with just the two of us to keep ourselves company.~
@743 = ~Hold a moment, <PLAYER1>. You dropped something back there during the last fight.~
@744 = ~(Rather than simply handing back the object she decides to stuff the item back into your pack herself, shamelessly taking the oppertunity to let her her free hand caress your body.)~
@745 = ~Ah! That tickles!~
@746 = ~Hmm, looking for something are we?~
@747 = ~(Try to guide her hand lower)~
@748 = ~(With a giggle her hand redoubles it's assault on your nerves and before long both of you are red with laughter.)~
@749 = ~(She grins and slides around your body before pulling you in for a kiss.)~
@750 = ~Mhh, found it...~
@751 = ~(Noticing what you're trying to do, she playfully swats your cheek with her other hand but does not pull away immediately.)~
@752 = ~Careful now <PLAYER1>. Patience is a virtue after all...~
@753 = ~(You feel her hand carelessly toying with the buckle of your belt as she kisses you. After what feels like an agonizing eternity she pulls away with an flushed yet impish expression.)~
@754 = ~I do not know if Helm intended for us to find each other. But I thank him nonetheless every time I see your smile.~
@755 = ~My love, you really need to take better care of yourself. Here, let me heal you.~
@756 = ~(Cassia takes a moment to brush the snow from your shoulders, but her hands seem to become distracted as you soon find her massaging your tense muscles.)~
@757 = ~My, you are tense today <PLAYER1>. I wonder why...~
@758 = ~(Cassia approaches you from behind and gives your cloak with a firm tug to straighten it out before turning you around and planting a kiss on your cheek.)~
@759 = ~There. Now you are ready to impress me once again with your heroism.~
@760 = ~Not now, <PLAYER1>. I wish to be alone with my thoughts.~
@761 = ~Can I help you, <PLAYER1>?~
@762 = ~(Flirt)~
@763 = ~Any thoughts about things in general?~
@764 = ~I would like to hear more about Helm, Cassia.~
@765 = ~What's your impression of the Dale?~
@766 = ~Do people often comment on your heritage?~
@767 = ~So does your fiendish heritage grant you any special powers?~
@768 = ~So you hail from Mirabar? What's it like?~
@769 = ~My lady, your faith is an inspiration to me in these dark times.~
@770 = ~So uhm... what would it take for you to put in a good word with Helm for me?~
@771 = ~What do you want to do once this is all over?~
@772 = ~How about we head down to the Root Cellar for a drink? Drinks are on me of course.~
@773 = ~Cassia, I need you to stop flirting with me.~
@774 = ~You can start flirting with me again Cassia.~
@775 = ~I'm sorry Cassia, but I think we should just remain friends.~
@776 = ~Not at the moment.~
@777 = ~Very well, <PLAYER1>.~
@778 = ~As you wish, <PLAYER1>.~
@779 = ~I am worried about Sir Lordranis and his group. It is most unlike them to have simply vanished.~
@780 = ~(She lowers her gaze to the ground.)~
@781 = ~Don't worry. I won't let their absence distract me from our efforts. At least this mission gives me something to focus on.~
@782 = ~How the people of Kuldahar ever slept soundly at night knowing the Vale of Shadows was nearby is beyond me. Those crypts should have been cleansed a long time ago.~
@783 = ~This pit breeds nothing but suffering and madness. It is a good thing we are here to cleanse it.~
@784 = ~We must hurry and uncover Arundel's murderer as quickly as possible. I fear a great calamity will befall us all should we fail.~
@785 = ~At least we have the Heartstone Gem and a lead to someone who can use it. Let us pray this 'Larrel' will be willing to aid us.~
@786 = ~The dwarves chose their location for this stronghold well. Without Larrel's aid we could have spent months scouring the mountainside looking for the entrance. I wonder how long it took the goblins and orcs to find this place?~
@787 = ~I know it sounds silly considering the temperatures here, but aren't you also nervous the palace of ice will just... melt?~
@788 = ~This place is worse than Dragon Eye! I feel like I'm being slowly cooked alive inside my armor.~
@789 = ~I also don't think I've ever seen a host compromised of so many different creatures. What manner of being could compel Salamanders, Orogs, Giants and Drow to work together? All under the banner of 'Ilmater' of all things! I do not like this one bit <PLAYER1>.~
@790 = ~Certainly. What is it you wish to know?~
@791 = ~Could you recite his tenets for me please.~
@792 = ~Why did you choose to worship Helm specifically?~
@793 = ~How is the Church of Helm organized?~
@794 = ~Who are his allies and enemies among the other gods?~
@795 = ~He seems like an austere personality. Who would want to worship him?~
@796 = ~Are there any celebrations or holy days dedicated in his honor?~
@797 = ~Never betray your trust. Be vigilant. Stand, wait, and watch carefully. Be fair and diligent in the conduct of your orders. Protect the weak, poor, injured and young, and do not sacrifice them for others or yourself.~
@798 = ~Anticipate attacks and be ready. Know your foes. Care for your weapons so they may perform their duties when called upon. Careful planning always defeats rushed actions in the end.~
@799 = ~Always obey orders, providing those orders follow the dictates of Helm. Demonstrate excellence and purity of loyalty in your role as a guardian and protector.~
@800 = ~Raised that way. The church of Helm is widely prevalent in Mirabar where I grew up and my foster father was a member of the clergy. And I've always held a deep respect for the stability and humility Helm represents.~
@801 = ~To me he is an unshakeable foundation that I can rely upon and aspire to emulate. He bears his responsibilities without complaint in his endless vigil against the forces chaos that would seek to irreperably harm Faerûn. And if my faith can help bring the stability to the realms that he envisions I will happily serve him.~
@802 = ~The church is organized in a strict military hierarchy. From High Watcher all the way down to the lowest acolyte, each member knows their assigned rank and duties.~
@803 = ~In the past we answered to a single Supreme Watcher but this position has remained vacant for over two centuries. Since then the Council of Helm has taken on the responsibility of ruling and directing the efforts of the faithful. It is comprised of four Archancels who are each responsible for a different region on Faerûn.~
@804 = ~There are of course a number of smaller sects and orders which are subserviant to the main body of the church who specialize in certain duties. The Watchers of the Fallen for example are a small fellowship of battlefield healers who tend to the wounded left on the battlefield. Or the Everwatch Knights, who are hired out as bodyguards by the church to those who need their protection. Lastly there would be the Vigilant Eyes of the Diety, an order of paladins who dedicate themselves to lives of selfless and humble service across the Realms.~
@805 = ~The Great Guard opposes any deity who would sow deceit and chaos on Faerûn and among it's inhabitants. The foul deities of Bane, Mask and Shar to name a few but the reckless destruction Talos brings has also earned him his ire.~
@806 = ~As for allies, there are very few whom Helm truly considers an ally. But Torm the True, deity of loyalty and duty has always supported him and thus held his respect as well.~
@807 = ~It is true that the Vigilant One has a reputation for being stern and uncompromising. But he is not incapable of forgiveness or nuance. He holds a soft spot in his heart for children and harkens us to forgive their youthful transgressions. To the peasant in the fields he promises protection freely given without charge and to a watchman he is their eyes and ears in the twilight.~
@808 = ~You will find his faith is very widespread and finds roots in the hearts of people from all walks in life. From Cormyr, to the Dragon Coast and from southern Tethyr to the Western Hearthlands you will find temples dedicated in his honor.~
@809 = ~Helm does not require festivals be held in his honor, as piety and humility are duties most trusted companion. But there is the Ceremony of Honor to Helm which is held during leap years on Shieldmeet, or simply the day after Midsummer.~
@810 = ~I actually had the oppertunity to celebrate it in Mirabar last year before I was sent north to the Ten Towns. The High Watcher had us light a candle upon the altar of the cathedral and tasked us with keeping the flame burning all throughout the day. Meanwhile the Watchknights were assembled and stationed around the temple where they stood guard in their freshly polished armor for hours without moving a muscle.~
@811 = ~(Smiles) The doors were flung open and the citizens invited to attend the sermons. We were supposed to attend to their requests and offer council and guidance to those who wished it. But I distinctly remember a group of street rats trying their best to provoke a reaction out of the Watchknight at the door. Nothing worked until one of them tried stealing the knight's purse.~
@812 = ~I'll never forget the sheer shock on their faces as the knight grabbed the boy by his wrist and hauled him in front of him while his compatriots took off screaming. But the knight didn't scold or harm the boy, and instead formally handed him his full purse and told him to buy some food for himself and his friends so that they wouldn't need to steal on this holy day.~
@813 = ~And then he went right back to his stoic self as if nothing ever happened. I never saw that boy again but I'd like to think things turned out alright for him.~
@814 = ~It's cold, obviously but I got used to the temperature faster than I had expected. The sense of community in the Ten Towns also feels much stronger than in other cities down south.~
@815 = ~The people are marked by both the harsh climate and the monsters that roam the tundra. There is a drive within them to stand together to face the challenges of the north. Whether out of stubborness or altruism I cannot say, but it is heartening sight to behold.~
@816 = ~Not as much as I was expecting, though that might have had something to do with the company of the Watchknights I shared. People are less willing to voice their closeminded opinions when in the presence of six-hundred pounds of plated steel.~
@817 = ~Why? Were you looking to add some of your own?~
@818 = ~There was a compliment or two at the tip of my tongue, but alas it seems to have slipped my mind.~
@819 = ~Just... if anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know alright?~
@820 = ~Certainly not. I only make derisive comments when out of earshot of the person in question.~
@821 = ~Well you 'are' rather strange looking.~
@822 = ~(Cassia gives you a suspicious look but then shrugs.)~
@823 = ~Well if you happen to find those compliments of yours feel free to let me know, will you?~
@824 = ~I don't need you to coddle me, <PLAYER1>. But I'll keep your promise in mind should it come up.~
@825 = ~(Cassia pauses and gives you an estimative glance before resolving that you must be joking as a small smile forms on her lips.)~
@826 = ~In that case I'll have you know that Helm demands of his servants to have 'very' good hearing. So be careful what you say.~
@827 = ~Then maybe you should spend more time looking at someone else because I'll make no apologies or compromises on how I look. It hasn't stopped me from performing my duties as a cleric and I am not about to let it start doing so.~
@828 = ~There was this one time I spilled boiling wax over my lap and walked away without any blisters if that's what you're talking about?~
@829 = ~Boiling wax!? How did that happen?~
@830 = ~Strange, I thought tieflings usually manifested minor magics of their own.~
@831 = ~I was thinking more along the lines of turning milk sour and shedding sulfur.~
@832 = ~(Sigh) It happened when I was still an initiate... I must have been twelve or thirteen at the time. Anyway, I and some of the others had been tasked with making some new prayer candles for the altars. So we made our way over to the candlemaker who was more than happy to provide a space for us to work and we got about melting down the wax.~
@833 = ~The problems really stemmed from the candlemakers pet though. He had this huge tabby cat which stood up to my knee and Mr. Mittens did not take kindly to these strange kids invading his domain. The creature waited patiently until it was time for me to lift the cauldron of boiling wax from the fireplace when it decided to hurl itself at my legs. I lost my balance and the cauldron ended up spilling all over the floor and myself.~
@834 = ~Naturally the candlemaker took the cat's side. Even moreso after it became clear that I was fine. Called me all sorts of things you usually shouldn't call a child, teenager or not and sent us packing. I did get some good fun out of peeling the dried wax off of my hands and clothes at least.~
@835 = ~There is hardly anything usual about those touched with an infernal ancestry. And I do not appreciate your attempts to rationalize or catalogue it.~
@836 = ~People have told me I have a sense of humor that could curdle milk. I'm not quite sure what they meant by that, but I'm guessing that's not what you were thinking of.~
@837 = ~Why the sudden interest in my heritage? What possible insights could you hope to gain from pursuing this topic.~
@838 = ~I was hoping you might know some tricks that could help us.~
@839 = ~Just being curious is all.~
@840 = ~Because it's a great opportunity! Think of the power you could harness!~
@841 = ~Even if I did, I wouldn't use them. Relying on the powers of a devil over the blessings of Helm would be an affront to not only him but also myself. And the prayers I speak to him grant me powers which won't come at the price of my soul or that of someone else.~
@842 = ~Blind curiousity is best reserved for topics that are less serious and prone to drawing attention from the lower planes. If you don't mind, <PLAYER1>, I would like to drop this subject from here on out.~
@843 = ~No, I'd really rather not. The path you propose is one that leads to pain, suffering and the damnation of the soul. Nothing a devil ever gives you is free of charge and they will 'always' find a way to claim their due.~
@844 = ~This adventure may draw to a close but the North is still filled with horrors that would prey upon the meek. I think I will remain within the Ten Towns for years to come.~
@845 = ~So long as evil threatens the people of the North, my duty demands that I stand in rank to raise my shield for their protection. Until the day comes when I am too old to do so and the Vigilant One beckons me to his side.~
@846 = ~Hm, that would entirely depend on what the High Watcher would demand of me. I don't know if he'd believe half the things when I tell him about our adventure. But I do hope he'll at least give me some reprieve so I can visit my family again.~
@847 = ~W-well... There would be a great many things that would have to be done but I am hopeful that I would be able to remain at your side, <PLAYER1>.~
@848 = ~Of course, Cassia. I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@849 = ~Would your responsibilities even allow for that? I do not know how long I will remain in the Ten Towns.~
@850 = ~Are there any particular places you would want to visit?~
@851 = ~Then that is how it shall be. Wherever our future may take us I will be happy to share it with you, my love.~
@852 = ~I see no reason why the High Watcher would deny my petition to travel abroad. Faerûn is a vast place after all and Helm's guidance is surely needed in more places than the north.~
@853 = ~(Smiles) Besides, he needn't know the exact motives behind my request. And I think I deserve to be a little selfish in this instance.~
@854 = ~Hm, I'd probably like to visit Mirabar again, if only to let my parents know that I am alive and well. Besides that I would of course like to visit the various strongholds of my faith throughout the south such as the Cathedral of Helm in Neverwinter or perhaps the Citadel of Protection in Raven's Bluff to the east.~
@855 = ~But you needn't trouble yourself on my account alone. I am sure you have your own ideas for a destination so we will definitely have to find something we can both agree on.~
@856 = ~(Cassia looks disappointed but nods resolutely.)~
@857 = ~Very well. We shouldn't let personal feelings get in the way of the mission.~
@858 = ~(Cassia looks visibly hurt by your words but after a moment composes herself, masking her emotions behind a mask.)~
@859 = ~I... very well. I won't bother you any longer and will refocus my attention on the mission.~
@860 = ~Hmm, well the city itself was built atop one of the holdings of the Gharraghaur Clan by human settlers a few hundred years ago. The cooperation between the two groups is what made Mirabar into the center of wealth it is today.~
@861 = ~At it's core, the city serves two purposes: As a both a fortress to safeguard trade in the region and as a staging point for excavations taking place in the surrounding foothills. As such the ruling body of Mirabar is mostly concerned with maintaining it's security and wealth within the hostile environment.~
@862 = ~Are such attacks a frequent problem?~
@863 = ~When you say ruling body, what do you mean by that?~
@864 = ~Who does the city trade with?~
@865 = ~Thank you for satisfying my curiosity, Cassia.~
@866 = ~Oh yes, though most groups usually refrain from attacking the city directly. Marauding bands of Orcs and Goblins are the usual suspects, preying on merchants and caravans that travel the roads. But occasionally some of the Uthgardt will emerge from the nearby forests looking for a fight.~
@867 = ~The cities militia is called the 'Axe of Mirabar' and is mostly comprised of dwarves and humans. And while they concern themselves with keeping the city and the surrounding area safe from outside threats, there are also the agents of the so-called 'Shadow District' who work to root out crime and spies sent by other cities.~
@868 = ~All in all they are very good at what they do. A touch draconian in their methods perhaps but for many citizens it is a small price to pay for the peace and security they enjoy.~
@869 = ~In theory, the city is ruled by a hereditary position called the Marchion. But in practice the elected assembly of the Council of Sparkling Stones holds most of the political power. They are the ones that set the quotas for the miners, mandate the work orders for supplies and greenlight any prospecting ventures for fresh veins of ore.~
@870 = ~Now the Marchion might not like being reminded of the limits of his or her power. But in reality there is very little they can do about it. When other cities or political entities wish to talk business in Mirabar, they deal with the Council. Which means that they get to set their prices and cut deals however they please without the Marchion's input.~
@871 = ~Of course, the Council of Sparkling Stones does it's best to ensure they give the Marchion no reason to act against them and keep their voters happy, both human and dwarf alike.~
@872 = ~Luskan is the primary trading partner for Mirabar and it through them that the ores and quarried stones are ferried down along the Sword Coast to Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, even as far south as Amn and Athkatla at times!~
@873 = ~The fact of the matter is that there are few friendly settlements near Mirabar, so the strained relationship the city has with Luskan is moreoften than not one born out of neccessity for contact with the outside world. I suppose you could describe it as something of a bottleneck or floodgate connecting the city with the rest of the Sword Coast's economical web.~
@874 = ~Why do you say that?~
@875 = ~Because moving large quantities of stone and ore by land is incredibly slow and expensive. If goods weren't being shipped down along the River Mirar towards Luskan and along the sea from there, you would have to take the gap between the Lurkwood and the Neverwinter Wood down through Triboar to the south all the way to Waterdeep. And paying the manpower to keep those caravan's safe coupled with the added travel time simply wouldn't be worth the investment.~
@876 = ~And so we try our best to forget about that one time the Prince of Illusk tried to conquer Mirabar, and tolerate the string of spies and agitators they send to our walls.~
@877 = ~Certainly. It was my pleasure.~
@878 = ~If you don't mind me asking, what kind of impression has my telling left on you about the city?~
@879 = ~It sounds like a grand place. Perhaps I shall visit it someday as well.~
@880 = ~Not much of one. It seems no different from any other cities I've visited so far.~
@881 = ~I'll be honest, it think it must be a terrible place to live.~
@882 = ~If you do visit, you should go during the Midsummer when they're holding the annual Mirar Run. Plenty of betting and fun to be had during the khyek races along the river during that time.~
@883 = ~It certainly seemed a lot more orderly than any of the Ten Towns I've visited. Then again, I have not traveled much beyond the southern shore of the Mirar River so you may have a better perspective than I.~
@884 = ~(She frowns) You are entitled to your opinion, of course. But I've seen far worse conditions in Luskan and Bryn Shander when I visited them.~
@885 = ~(Cassia arches an eyebrow expectantly at you.)~
@886 = ~(Tell her a joke)~
@887 = ~(Try and strike a heroic pose)~
@888 = ~(Smile widely at her)~
@889 = ~(Watch her as you walk)~
@890 = ~(Offer her a drink from your waterskin)~
@891 = ~(Offer to polish her armor)~
@892 = ~(Pretend like you are limping)~
@893 = ~(Try to walk in stride with her)~
@894 = ~(Take a moment to admire her horns)~
@895 = ~(Strike up a tune on your instrument)~
@896 = ~(Kiss her)~
@897 = ~(Move to hug her)~
@898 = ~(Try and touch her tail)~
@899 = ~Actually, nevermind.~
@900 = ~I uhm... I'm sorry, <PLAYER1> I don't get it. Could you repeat it please?~
@901 = ~(Cassia snorts but you can see her lips twitch as she desperately tries to fight back a smile.)~
@902 = ~(Her face is impassive at first but then breaks into a grin revealing her sharp teeth as she shakes her head snickering to herself.)~
@903 = ~Alright, that's a good one. You got me <PLAYER1>~
@904 = ~And just what do you think you're doing, <PLAYER1>?~
@905 = ~(Cassia rolls her eyes and keeps moving.)~
@906 = ~Show off.~
@907 = ~(You notice Cassia's gaze lingering on you for a bit as she hums appreciatively but then quickly shakes her head.)~
@908 = ~Come along, <PLAYER1>. Wouldn't want you to freeze stiff out here standing about like that.~
@909 = ~Are you alright <PLAYER1>? You look... happy?~
@910 = ~(Cassia gives you a confused look before shrugging and continuing on about her business.)~
@911 = ~(Trying to mirror your smile, Cassia breaks into an awkward smile as she glances self consciously about.)~
@912 = ~...why are we smiling again?~
@913 = ~Are you always this distracted, <PLAYER1>? Keep a wary eye about! Our enemies could be lurking behind every corner.~
@914 = ~(Cassia keeps her gaze locked ahead, her holy symbol clinking against her breastplate as she walks.)~
@915 = ~(Noticing your gaze, Cassia tilts her head briefly in your direction. When your eyes meet she immediately snaps her gaze away.)~
@916 = ~(For the next few minutes seems to do everything she can to avoid eye contact with you.)~
@917 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1> but I've still got plenty in my own waterskin.~
@918 = ~The offer is appreciated but I will manage by myself. You surely have more need of it than I and you needn't go thirsty on my account.~
@919 = ~(Reluctantly Cassia accepts the offered waterskin and tilting her head back takes a deep swig from the liquid, droplets running down her chin and onto her armor.)~
@920 = ~Mh, much better. Thank you, <PLAYER1>.~
@921 = ~Not now, <PLAYER1>. You are talented but I can ill afford the distraction at the moment.~
@922 = ~(Cassia shows little emotion during your performance but as you draw to a close she offers you a faint smile.)~
@923 = ~I'll admit, I've never had much taste in music. But the songs you play are... soothing. To me at least.~
@924 = ~(Cassia listens with rapt attention, her eyes fixated on you and your performance. As the song draws to a close she shakes herself and looks guilty.)~
@925 = ~To think I let myself to become distracted so easily. And yet I can't help but wish the moment lasted a while longer.~
@926 = ~(Cassia melts into your arms and for a moment she seems to forget about the world around her.)~
@927 = ~Mhhh! A little warning next time <PLAYER1>!~
@928 = ~(She seems surprised at first by your sudden advances but does not pull away as she cups the back of your head with a mailed gauntlet.)~
@929 = ~(You brush against her tail causing her to whirl around as she gives you a bewildered look.)~
@930 = ~Wha- oh! would you please refrain from doing that, <PLAYER1>! You startled me!~
@931 = ~(As you reach out your hand the wily appendage seems to notice your intent and slips itself out of reach, coiling itself around Cassia's leg who turns to look at you with a bemused expression.)~
@932 = ~Was there something you were looking for, <PLAYER1>?~
@933 = ~(You reach your hand towards the tail but it quickly slips from your grasp and give you an almost painful slap on the wrist.)~
@934 = ~(As you rub you massage your wrist you swear you can hear Cassia humming innocently to herself.)~
@935 = ~And your faith likewise inspires me, milord. It is always a pleasure to share the company of a champion of righteousness.~
@936 = ~Your chivalry is seen and appreciated, milord. Know that the lady in question smiles favourably upon your courageous actions.~
@937 = ~It gladdens my heart to hear this, milady. May our actions shine as a beacon of hope for the people of the north.~
@938 = ~(Sigh) Don't worry. I am sure the Great Guard has more pressing concerns than your petty larceny.~
@939 = ~Truthfully, <PLAYER1>. There is nothing I could say to him that you could not do yourself. Though you'll find it difficult to hide any falsehoods from him, if you do petition him.~
@940 = ~If you truly wished to turn your life around, then perhaps there would be something I could do for you <PLAYER1>. But you'll have to forgive me if I have my doubts about your sincerity.~
@941 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>, but you needn't make the effort. It's a routine I've grown more than used to by now.~
@942 = ~Er... no offense, but now really isn't the time. Ask me again when we settle down to rest.~
@943 = ~I'd hate to compound your duties by neglecting mine. But it you insist...~
@944 = ~(She tosses you a rag and a bottle of aging grease before waiting patiently for you to begin your ministrations.)~
@945 = ~(By the time you have finished her armor is left gleaming in a fresh coat of fat and she nods curtly surveying your handiwork.)~
@946 = ~Not bad. But I can handle the remaining parts you couldn't get to once we make camp.~
@947 = ~(Noticing your limp, Cassia takes you aside and inspects your leg.)~
@948 = ~Strange, it looked like something was wrong but it seems I was mistaken.~
@949 = ~(Sigh) <PLAYER1>, do you really think that as a practiced healer I wouldn't be able to tell when someone is faking a limp? I've seen more than my share of initiates trying to do just that to get out of a lecture back in Mirabar.~
@950 = ~You know there are easier ways of getting my attention <PLAYER1>. Stop walking like that before you actually hurt yourself.~
@951 = ~(The pace is brisk, but you manage to keep up and before long you are marching in tandem. Noticing this, Cassia to briefly glances at you with a chuckle and then pulls away from you.)~
@952 = ~(As you move next to Cassia you accidentally bump into her causing her to stumble.)~
@953 = ~Watch where you're walking, <PLAYER1>!~
@954 = ~(You move side by side for a while but soon your lungs begin to burn, unused to the pace at which Cassia is moving and she soon leaves you behind.)~
@955 = ~(The ram-like growths coil around her scalp protectively, the ribbed rivets running thinner and thinner until they reach the tips. You idly wonder how strong Cassia's neck must be in order to carry their added weight.)~
@956 = ~(Oblivious to your observations, Cassia reaches up to her right horn and scratches it. You see black flakes falling away like dead skin and onto the ground.)~
@957 = ~(Cassia notices your gaze upon her and rolls her eyes before turning around, giving you a full view of the horns from all angles.)~
@958 = ~There, is your curiousity satisfied <PLAYER1>?~
@959 = ~(Enveloping Cassia in your arms she comes to rest her chin on your shoulder. She hums contentedly as you sway slightly to a fro in your embrace.)~
@960 = ~(As your arms snake around her waist Cassia places her hands on your chest, smiling at you with a twinkle in her crimson eyes.)~
@961 = ~(Cassia is caught off guard at first as your arms close around her but realising it is you she relaxes and lets her fingers run idly down the back of your neck.)~
@962 = ~(Noticing your intent, Cassia kneels down with an eager smile and pulls you in for a hug, humming contentedly as her head comes to rest on your shoulder.)~
@963 = ~If you feel like we have the time... why not. But I'll be holding you to that promise once we get there.~
@964 = ~Sir Lordranis?! W-what are you doing here!~
@965 = ~What has been done to you!? I had thought you were dead after you didn't return for the expeditions departure! And where are the others?~
@966 = ~From the sounds of it this villain you describe is the one and same <PLAYER1> and I have tracked to this glacier. Is there anything you can tell us of him?~
@967 = ~Before we leave, we need to get you and the other prisoners out of here. Allow us to do what we can to free you from your captivity.~
@968 = ~<PLAYER1>, please! Sir Lordranis is the last surviving member of the contingent of knights which was sent to Easthaven with me. I cannot in good conscience abandon him and the other slaves to their fate!~
@969 = ~Alright we'll help, since it seems to matter so much to you.~
@970 = ~Okay, fine! We'll see what we can do.~
@971 = ~Too bad. They will have to fend for themselves.~
@972 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>. You wont regret this!~
@973 = ~But-!~
@974 = ~I... as you wish. Farewell Sir Lordranis.~
@975 = ~I... thank you Sir Lordranis. I shall endeavor to see it is put to good use in the coming battles.~
@976 = ~Those days are nearing their end. Once <PLAYER1> and I are done with this place nobody will dare lay a hand on you ever again.~
@977 = ~And may the Vigilant One raise his warding hand above this community. Come <PLAYER1>. Let us see what further aid we can offer to the inhabitants of this place.~
@978 = ~The Missing Watchknights
It seems the knights Cassia was traveling with will not return in time to accompany the caravan. Perhaps we will discover some sign of them while traveling the Dale.~  
@979 = ~The Missing Watchknights
We found the last of the surviving Watchknights who once traveled with Cassia trapped in a frost giant cave in the Wyrmstooth Glacier. He begged us to do what we can to free the other slaves that are trapped here with him but we've more important things to do than worry about the wellbeing of a few slaves.~ 
@980 = ~Definitely only as a companion. But one I am glad to be able to rely on.~
@981 = ~I love you <PLAYER1>, from the bottom of my heart.~
@982 = ~To one such as you perhaps, Helmite.~
@983 = ~What's that?~
@984 = ~Knowing the nature of my work I highly doubt that. Though if you are volunteering...~
@985 = ~Oh I'm just 'so' glad to have your approval missy.~
@986 = ~Perhaps, though not a day goes by where I do not pray to Ilmater for the Mother's safe return.~
@987 = ~Your god has no business involving himself here, Helmite. And I will not tolerate your impudent posturing within these hallowed halls of Myrkul.~
@988 = ~I do not know but I beseech you to release my kin from their suffering.~
@989 = ~I am sure the fool couldn't have gotten far. And you'd better find him if you want the information I am offering.~
@990 = ~Then that is where we shall seek refuge. I thank you again for bringing us the key to our freedom!~
@991 = ~I pray for your success. Defend yourselves!~ 
@992 = ~Oh please, as if there's anything 'you' could do about it.~
@993 = ~This conflict was started by you and your incessant desire for expansion. Now, no price is too great to pay for the freedom of our way of life.~
@994 = ~(The dragon bares it's fangs at Cassia as an angry rumble escapes it's throat.)~
@995 = ~Filthy Banites! The only aid you shall get from us is a swift deliverance to your foul master!~ 
@996 = ~(With a chuckle Cassia joins you in your posturing.)~
@997 = ~Auditioning for the statues they will build of us?~
@998 = ~(You notice Cassia's gaze lingering on you for a bit as she hums appreciatively.)~
@999 = ~Hmm, I could get used to a view like that <PLAYER1>.~
@1000 = ~As much as I appreciate the attention <PLAYER1>, I would hate to distract you from our battles.~
@1001 = ~(Noticing your gaze, Cassia tilts her head briefly in your direction. When your eyes meet she runs a hand through her raven black hair as she gives you an alluring smile.)~
@1002 = ~(Cassia readily accepts the offered waterskin and tilting her head back takes a deep swig from the liquid, droplets running down her chin and onto her armor.)~
@1003 = ~(Cassia hums along to your performance, having heard it many times before by now. As you draw to a close she offers you a faint smile.)~
@1004 = ~A wonderful performance as always, <PLAYER1>.~
@1005 = ~(She gives you a devilish smile) I could think of a few ways you might entice me to do such a thing. But I make no promises.~
@1006 = ~Since you asked so nicely.~
@1007 = ~(She tosses you a rag and a bottle of aging grease flashing you a smile as you to begin your ministrations.)~
@1008 = ~(By the time you have finished her armor is left gleaming in a fresh coat of grease. Cassia smiles admiring your handiwork before planting a kiss on your cheek.)~
@1009 = ~You're getting better at this. Perhaps I ought to let you do the rest of the pieces one day...~
@1010 = ~(The pace is brisk, but you manage to keep up and before long you are marching in tandem. Noticing this, Cassia takes your hand as her fingers entwine with yours.)~
@1011 = ~(As you move next to Cassia you accidentally bump into her causing her to stumble before catching herself.)~
@1012 = ~(Rather than being upset, Cassia gives you a wicked grin and a few moments later returns the favor as you are both sent tumbling to the ground in a fit of laughter.)~
@1013 = ~(You move side by side for a while but soon your lungs begin to burn, unused to the pace at which Cassia is moving. Noticing this she slows her walk and gives you an encouraging hug.)~
@1014 = ~(Cassia notices your gaze upon her proudly turns around, giving you a full view of the horns from all angles.)~
@1015 = ~You have a beautiful smile, <PLAYER1>.~
@1016 = ~You look happy, <PLAYER1>. Did something good happen?~
@1017 = ~We can speculate on a number of reasons how that might have happened but I can say with certainty that no true child of Moradin would ever deign to sell their treasured artifacts to orcs!~
@1018 = ~Then you are as naive as we were. What other explanation could there have possibly been for this betrayal?~
@1024 = ~Whatever comes next, we face it together <PLAYER1>.~
@1025 = ~Hold a moment, <PLAYER1>. Before we continue I- I would like to discuss 'us' before we tread any further... Is it too early to call it us? You've shown an interest in me during our travels I think... and I must confess to having fallen for your charms, which has left me at a loss on how to proceed.~
@1026 = ~I knew you'd come around eventually. Come here.~
@1027 = ~Good morning, my love. You look so peaceful when you sleep (giggles).~
@1028 = ~Good morning to you too. Did you rest well?~
@1029 = ~Mhh, I had a wonderful dream last night...~
@1030 = ~(Groan) just a few more minutes...~
@1031 = ~My hair is a mess, I ache all over and I'm pretty sure I've misplaced my left gauntlet. (She grins) But I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@1032 = ~(She snickers) The tail makes everything better, doesn't it?~
@1033 = ~Come along then, <PLAYER1>. We've still a battle ahead of us and if you don't start moving soon I'll go fetch some snow from outside.~
@1034 = ~(She playfully brushes a strand of hair out of your face and places a kiss on your forehead.)~
@1035 = ~One final battle <PLAYER1>. And after that I'll let you crawl back under those blankets if you want. And probably join you as well, if it pleases you.~    
@1036 = ~You'd let that halfling just kill whoever he wants and get away with it? No, I cannot accept this, <PLAYER1>. I won't stand by and watch this injustice unfold. The two of you—you deserve each other.~
@1037 = ~Your skull shall make a fitting offering for my mistress.~   //@1036 is next
@1038 =~I hope there's a special place in the hells just waiting for you, murderer.~
@1039 = ~By Helm that tortured thing looked even more unseemly than I was expecting! What manner of twisted monstrosity flays it's victims in such a fashion but leaves both sinew and muscle intact?~
@1040 = ~Whatever it is, we'll put an end to it.~
@1041 = ~You aren't squeamish are you? You look a bit green.~
@1042 = ~Fascinating isn't it? I'm practically brimming with curiousity now!~
@1043 = ~Its head is just another payday waiting to be collected.~
@1044 = ~Aye, right you are. The killings end today.~
@1045 = ~I'm fine. I'm simply used to undead creatures have either more skin or less flesh.~
@1046 = ~I dare not ask why the skinned dead would prompt such curiousity from you. But hopefully it will lead to us concluding our business here quickly.~ 
@1047 = ~Perhaps once it has been dealt with a group could be sent to retrieve and burn the bodies. Their corpses should not be left to the elements in such a dark place.~
@1048 = ~And so the creator goes the way of his creation. Good riddance! Though I am ill at ease knowing their sister is still on the loose. I pray wherever she is she will meet a similar fate.~
@1049 = ~I'm sure she'll get caught in her own schemes eventually.~
@1050 = ~She might not actually be evil you know? She wanted nothing to do with her brothers after all.~
@1051 = ~We've got more important things to worry about.~
@1052 = ~But how many victims will she claim before she is stopped? We could... no. It would be a waste of time to devote further resources to a search.~
@1053 = ~I wouldn't be so sure. What kind of sick and twisted experiments must she be involved so that even her brothers would want nothing to do with her? The same people who created that monster we just brought down!~
@1054 = ~Perhaps you are right. However it doesn't sit fully right with me.~
@1055 = ~Ah, don't mind me <PLAYER1>. We did a good thing putting an end to this menace and today, that is good enough.~
@1056 = ~Ah, Yondalla. Had I been born a Halfling in another life, then perhaps it would be her symbol I would carry, rather than Helms.~
@1057 = ~You approve of her then?~
@1058 = ~I'm not too familiar with Yondalla. Could you refresh my memory?~
@1059 = ~I think you would make an excellent sister, Cassia.~
@1060 = ~It looks pretty valuable. I wonder how much coin this will fetch us.~
@1061 = ~Of course. We can all take an example from the dedication with which she watches over her worshippers and their communities. And in some way I wish my own actions could provide the same kind of comfort and protection she offers.~
@1062 = ~I can only tell you what is common knowledge. She is known as the Nurturing Matriarch, and it is said she created all of halfling-kind in her image. And she watches over her children with a loving care like any mother would watch their children.~
@1063 = ~She is also associated with fertility, and it is said that any halfling who has his fields and vinyards blessed by her will never know hunger in even the deepest winters.~
@1064 = ~Thank you, <PLAYER1>. That is very kind of you to say so.~
@1065 = ~I would think twice before trying to cheat these halflings, especially when their goddess is involved. Fair tempered she may be but her wrath is said to be truly terrible when it is provoked.~
@1066 = ~But, let us see what we can do about this delivery. Lonelywood is quite a ways away but perhaps an opportunity will present itself.~
@1067 = ~Hmm, now this place reminds of a dwarven gemcutter who had set up shop a few blocks away from my mothers sewing store.~
@1068 = ~His name was Bëmbul, if I recall correctly. "Bëmbul's Radiant Rings". Whenever I would visit home, I would stop and admire the artisanry he had put on display. Eventually he would get nervous and shoo me along though. His growing paranoia for thieves was all too apparent at times.~
@1069 = ~How do you figure he was paranoid?~
@1070 = ~Hmm, I wonder who can afford this luxury in Kuldahar.~
@1071 = ~I didn't know you liked jewellery Cassia. Could I buy you something?~
@1072 = ~Because I noticed how he would watch me like a hawk whenever I was in his store. And he'd always look for an excuse to keep me in his sights if I happened to move to the other side of a shelf.~
@1073 = ~There must be enough paying to justify staying open. Though with the passes frozen the stream of customers must have dried up.~
@1074 = ~Bëmbul was also something of a miser. He would also come by to pester the Watchknights stationed outside in his off hours, demanding that they send someone to guard his shop. But whenever the High Watcher offered to send someone in exchange for a modest pay, he'd refuse to pay.~
@1075 = ~Ah, well what can you do.~
@1076 = ~Cutting corners on security eh? Interesting...~ 
@1077 = ~I wasn't aware Watchknights could be hired out like that.~
@1078 = ~Considering the track record of the militia for apprehending criminals in Mirabar I think he'll be fine.~
@1079 = ~There is actually an entire order dedicated to selling their services as bodyguards called the Everwatch Knights. But they are quite discerning in choosing whom to lend their aid to.~
@1080 = ~I'd rather you didn't. Our funds have more pressing allocations than my own vanity. But it is nice to relive those memories once again.~
@1081 = ~I... no best not. There are better things to spend our funds on then my own vanity. And I wouldn't even know what to pick from the selection on display...~
@1082 = ~Please, I insist. Something small at least.~
@1083 = ~As leader it is my decision how our funds are best spent. Now what would you like?~ 
@1084 = ~Suit yourself.~
@1085 = ~(Sigh) Very well <PLAYER1>. In that case I would like... this silver ring.~
@1086 = ~It might be plain, but it is reminiscent of Helm's argent gauntlet. And it takes dedication and care to keep this metals lustre. That pleases me.~
@1087 = ~Then a silver ring you shall have.~
@1088 = ~Are you sure? There's no need to be stingy.~
@1089 = ~I've made my decision and I am satisfied with it.~
@1090 = ~But I thank you for this gift, <PLAYER1>. It is very thoughtful of you.~ 
@1091 = ~(She blushes as she admires the carvings on the ring in the palm of her hand before slipping it over her finger.)~
@1092 = ~...Thank you for the gift, <PLAYER1>. It is very thoughtful of you.~
@1093 = ~Hopefully whatever forces brought that fleabag back to life won't come back to haunt us. Kuldahar has enough troubles without a proverbial black cat running around.~ 
@1094 = ~Tread carefully <PLAYER1>. I can feel an old pain festering here. How many have lost their lives within the frozen waters around us to have caused such a disturbance I wonder?~
@1095 = ~There has to be a way to mend this.~
@1096 = ~We must discover what lured them here quickly before it grows worse.~
@1097 = ~I've no intention of joining them, regardless of what brought them here.~ 
@1098 = ~Either way it should be dealt with quickly. This presence cannot remain as it is while it still represents a threat to the hunters and travelers in the region.~
@1099 = ~And this must be the chest the gnome was talking about. And the locks are intact as well! Helm be praised for small mercies at least. I was beginning to worry it's contents had already been plundered.~
